<h3><a name="BIANKIS_VISION" id="BIANKIS_VISION"></a>BIANKI&rsquo;S VISION</h3>

<p class="center">(Kiowa Drawing)</p>

<p><i>The ghost-dance among the Sioux was based on the belief that the dead
Indians would all come to life and drive out the white intruders. Then
the buffaloes, which were disappearing, would come back in the immense
herds of the olden time.</i></p>

<p><i>The vision of one of the dreamer priests is represented. After
reaching the spirit world, Bianki found himself on a vast prairie
covered with innumerable buffaloes and ponies. He went through the
herds (dotted lines) until he came to a large Kiowa camp, with its
ornament tepees. He met four young women who had died years before,
and asked about two of his brothers, also dead. He soon met them
coming into camp, with buffalo meat hanging from their saddles.</i></p>

<h2>PREFACE</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">F</span>rom the edge of the Darkening Land, where
stand the mountains which encircle the earth-plain,
eastward toward the Sunland, lie the great
plains of America. Smooth and flat and green they
stretch away, hundreds of miles, rising from a dead
level into a soft rolling of the land, then into the long
green waves of the prairies where rivers flow, where the
water ripples as it flows, and trees shade the banks of
the gleaming water.</p>

<p>Here, amidst the vast sweep of the plains which
stretch away to the horizon on every side, boundless,
limitless, endless, lived the plains Indians. Standing
in the midst of this vast green plain on a soft May
morning, after the Thunder Gods have passed, when
the sun is shining in the soft blue above, and the
sweet, rain-swept air is blown about by the Four
Winds which are always near to man, day and night,&mdash;standing
far out on the plains with no hint of the
white man or his work&mdash;one sees the earth somewhat
as the Indian saw it and wonders not at his reverence
for the Mysterious One who dwelt overhead, beyond
the blue stone arch, and for the lesser powers which
came to him over the four paths guarded by the Four
Winds. It was Wakoda, the Mysterious One, who
gave to man the sunshine, the clear rippling water,
the clear sky from which all storms, all clouds are
absent, the sky which is the symbol of peace. Through
this sky sweeps the eagle, the &ldquo;Mother&rdquo; of Indian
songs, bearing upon her strong wings the message of
peace and calling to her nestlings as she flies. Little
wonder that to some tribes song was an integral part of
their lives, and that emotions too deep for words were
expressed in song.</p>

<p>Other songs there were, with words, songs of the
birds which fly through that soft, tender blue:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">All around the birds in flocks are flying;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Dipping, rising, circling, see them coming.</span><br />
<span class="i0">See, many birds are flocking here,</span><br />
<span class="i0">All about us now together coming.</span><br />
</div>
</div>

<p style="margin-left: 15em;">[<i>Pawnee</i>]</p>

<p>The power to fly has always inspired Indians of all
tribes and of all degrees of civilization with wonder and
reverence. The bird chiefs have their own places in
Indian myths. Owl is chief of the night; Woodpecker,
with his ceaseless tattoo on the trees, is chief of the trees;
Duck is chief of the water; but Eagle is chief of the
day. It is always Eagle who is chief of the birds, even
though Wren may outwit him in a tale told by the
fire glimmering in the tepee, when the story tellers of
the tribe tell of the happenings in the days &ldquo;way
beyond.&rdquo; It is Eagle who inspires admiration, and
becomes the most sacred bird.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Round about a tree in ever widening circles an eagle flies, alert, watching o&rsquo;er his nest;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Loudly whistles he, a challenge sending far, o&rsquo;er the country wide it echoes, there defying foes.</span><br />
</div>
</div>

<p style="margin-left: 15em;">[<i>Pawnee</i>]</p>

<p>In the breeze that rippled the long grass of the prairie
and fluttered the flaps of the graceful tepee, waved
also the corn, sent by Old-Woman-Who-Never-Dies,
the ever returning life of the green thing growing. In
the ravines and on the lower slopes of the grassy waves
of the prairie bellowed the buffalo, or grazed in silence,
having long since come up from the underground
world and become the source of the Indian&rsquo;s food,
clothing, home, utensils, and comfort. Endless were
the charms and enchantments to bring the buffalo herds
near his camping ground. Severe was the punishment
meted out to the thoughtless warrior whose unguarded
eagerness frightened the herds and sent them away.</p>

<p>Over the plains and prairies, at other times, swept
the Thunder Gods, with their huge jointed wings,
darkening all the land, and flashing fire from angry
eyes which struck down man and beast. Terrified were
the Indians when the Thunder Gods rolled. Vows
made to them must be kept, for relentless were they.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, grandfather,&rdquo; prayed the Indian when the
sky was black and the lightning flashed, as he filled
a pipe with tobacco and offered it skyward, &ldquo;Oh,
grandfather! I am very poor. Somewhere make
those who would injure me leave a clear space for me.&rdquo;
Then he put the sacred green cedar upon the fire&mdash;the
cedar which stayed awake those seven nights and therefore
does not lose its hair every winter&mdash;and the smoke
from the sacred, burning wood, rolling upward, appeased
the rolling Thunders.</p>

<p>The authorities used in this compilation are those
found in the annual reports of the Bureau of American
Ethnology and the Publications of the United States
Geographical and Geological Survey: contributions to
North American Ethnology. Of the various ethnologists
whose work has been used, those of especial importance
are Alice C. Fletcher, whose wonderful work
among the Omaha and Pawnee Indians is deserving of
the most careful study, J. Owen Dorsey, James Mooney,
and S. R. Riggs.</p>

<p>No claim whatever is made for original work. Indeed,
original work of any kind in a compilation such
as this would impair the authenticity of the myths, and
therefore destroy the value of this work. Nor has any
effort been made towards &ldquo;style.&rdquo; The only style
worth having in telling an Indian legend is that of the
Indian himself.</p>

<h2 style="padding-bottom: 3em;">MYTHS AND LEGENDS OF THE GREAT PLAINS</h2>



<h2>THE CREATION</h2>

<p class="subtitle">Osage (Wazh&aacute; zhe group)</p>


<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>ay beyond, once upon a time, some of
the Osages lived in the sky. They did not know
where they came from, so they went to Sun.
They said, &ldquo;From where did we come?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He said, &ldquo;You are my children.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then they wandered still further and came to Moon.</p>

<p>Moon said, &ldquo;I am your mother; Sun is your father.
You must go away from here. You must go down to
the earth and live there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So they came to the earth but found it covered with
water. They could not return up above. They wept,
but no answer came to them. They floated about in the
air, seeking help from some god; but they found none.</p>

<p>Now all the animals were with them. Elk was the
finest and most stately. They all trusted Elk. So they
called to Elk, &ldquo;Help us.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg&nbsp;20]</a></span>
Then Elk dropped into the water and began to sink.
Then he called to the winds. The winds came from all
sides and they blew until the waters went upwards, as
in a mist. Now before that the winds had traveled in
only two directions; they went from north to south and
from south to north. But when Elk called to them,
they came from the east, from the north, from the west,
and from the south. They met at a central place; then
they carried the waters upwards.</p>

<p>Now at first the people could see only the rocks.
So they traveled on the rocky places. But nothing
grew there and there was nothing to eat. Then the
waters continued to vanish. At last the people could
see the soft earth. When Elk saw the earth, he was so
joyous, he rolled over and over on the earth. Then all
the loose hairs clung to the soil. So the hairs grew, and
from them sprang beans, corn, potatoes, and wild turnips,
and at last all the grasses and trees.</p>

<p>Now the people wandered over the land. They
found human footsteps. They followed them. They
joined with them, and traveled with them in search of
food.</p>


<p class="subtitle">(Hoga group)</p>

<p>The Hoga came down from above, and found the
earth covered with water. They flew in every direction.
They sought for gods who would help them
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg&nbsp;21]</a></span>
and drive the water away. They found not one. Then
Elk came. He had a loud voice and he shouted to the
four corners of the sky. The four winds came in
answer. They blew upon the water and it vanished
upwards, in a mist. Then the people could see the
rocks. Now there was only a little space on the rocks.
They knew they must have more room. The people
were crowded. So they sent Muskrat down into the
water. He did not come back. He was drowned.
Then they sent Loon down. He did not come back.
He was drowned. Then they sent Beaver down into
the water. The water was too deep. Beaver was
drowned. Then Crawfish dived into the water. He
was gone a long time. When he came up there was a
little mud in his claws. Crawfish was so tired he died.
But the people took the mud out of his claws and made
the land.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg&nbsp;22]</a></span></p>
<h2>HOW THE WORLD WAS MADE</h2>

<p class="subtitle">Cherokee</p>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>he earth is a great floating island in a sea of
water. At each of the four corners there is a
cord hanging down from the sky. The sky is
of solid rock. When the world grows old and worn
out, the cords will break, and then the earth will sink
down into the ocean. Everything will be water again.
All the people will be dead. The Indians are much
afraid of this.</p>

<p>In the long time ago, when everything was all water,
all the animals lived up above in Galun&rsquo;lati, beyond the
stone arch that made the sky. But it was very much
crowded. All the animals wanted more room. The
animals began to wonder what was below the water
and at last Beaver&rsquo;s grandchild, little Water Beetle,
offered to go and find out. Water Beetle darted in
every direction over the surface of the water, but it
could find no place to rest. There was no land at all.
Then Water Beetle dived to the bottom of the water
and brought up some soft mud. This began to grow
and to spread out on every side until it became the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg&nbsp;23]</a></span>
island which we call the earth. Afterwards this earth
was fastened to the sky with four cords, but no one
remembers who did this.</p>

<p>At first the earth was flat and soft and wet. The
animals were anxious to get down, and they sent out
different birds to see if it was yet dry, but there was
no place to alight; so the birds came back to Galun&rsquo;lati.
Then at last it seemed to be time again, so they sent out
Buzzard; they told him to go and make ready for them.
This was the Great Buzzard, the father of all the
buzzards we see now. He flew all over the earth, low
down near the ground, and it was still soft. When he
reached the Cherokee country, he was very tired; his
wings began to flap and strike the ground. Wherever
they struck the earth there was a valley; whenever the
wings turned upwards again, there was a mountain.
When the animals above saw this, they were afraid
that the whole world would be mountains, so they
called him back, but the Cherokee country remains full
of mountains to this day. [This was the original home,
in North Carolina.]</p>

<p>When the earth was dry and the animals came down,
it was still dark. Therefore they got the sun and set it
in a track to go every day across the island from east
to west, just overhead. It was too hot this way. Red
Crawfish had his shell scorched a bright red, so that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg&nbsp;24]</a></span>
his meat was spoiled. Therefore the Cherokees do not
eat it.</p>

<p>Then the medicine men raised the sun a handsbreadth
in the air, but it was still too hot. They raised
it another time; and then another time; at last they had
raised it seven handsbreadths so that it was just under
the sky arch. Then it was right and they left it so.
That is why the medicine men called the high place
&ldquo;the seventh height.&rdquo; Every day the sun goes along
under this arch on the under side; it returns at night
on the upper side of the arch to its starting place.</p>

<p>There is another world under this earth. It is like
this one in every way. The animals, the plants, and
the people are the same, but the seasons are different.
The streams that come down from the mountains are
the trails by which we reach this underworld. The
springs at their head are the doorways by which we
enter it. But in order to enter the other world, one
must fast and then go to the water, and have one of the
underground people for a guide. We know that the
seasons in the underground world are different, because
the water in the spring is always warmer in winter
than the air in this world; and in summer the water is
cooler.</p>

<p>We do not know who made the first plants and animals.
But when they were first made, they were told
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg&nbsp;25]</a></span>
to watch and keep awake for seven nights. This is the
way young men do now when they fast and pray to
their medicine. They tried to do this. The first night,
nearly all the animals stayed awake. The next night
several of them dropped asleep. The third night still
more went to sleep. At last, on the seventh night, only
the owl, the panther, and one or two more were still
awake. Therefore, to these were given the power to see
in the dark, to go about as if it were day, and to kill and
eat the birds and animals which must sleep during the
night.</p>

<p>Even some of the trees went to sleep. Only the cedar,
the pine, the spruce, the holly, and the laurel were
awake all seven nights. Therefore they are always
green. They are also sacred trees. But to the other
trees it was said, &ldquo;Because you did not stay awake,
therefore you shall lose your hair every winter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After the plants and the animals, men began to come
to the earth. At first there was only one man and one
woman. He hit her with a fish. In seven days a little
child came down to the earth. So people came to the
earth. They came so rapidly that for a time it seemed
as though the earth could not hold them all.</p>

<h2>THE FLOOD AND THE RAINBOW</h2>

<p class="subtitle">Delaware (Lenni-Lenapi)</p>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>he Lenni-Lenapi are the First People, so that
they know this story is true.</p>

<p>After the Creation of the earth, the Mysterious
One covered it with a blue roof. Sometimes the roof
was very black. Then the Manitou of Waters became
uneasy. He feared the rain would no longer be able to
pour down upon the earth through this dark roof.
Therefore the Manitou of Waters prayed to the
Mysterious One that the waters from above be not
cut off.</p>

<p>At once the Mysterious One commanded to blow the
Spirit of the Wind, who dwells in the Darkening Land.
At once thick clouds arose. They covered all the earth,
so that the dark roof could no longer be seen.</p>

<p>Then the voice of the Mysterious One was heard
amongst the clouds. The voice was deep and heavy,
like the sound of falling rivers.</p>

<p>Then the Spirit of Rain, the brother of the Spirit
of Waters and the Spirit of the Winds, poured down
water from above. The waters fell for a long time.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg&nbsp;27]</a></span>
They fell until all the earth was covered. Then the
birds took refuge in the branches of the highest trees.
The animals followed the trails to the mountain peaks.</p>

<p>Then the Manitou of Waters feared no longer.
Therefore the Mysterious One ordered the rain to cease
and the clouds to disappear. Then Sin-go-wi-chi-na-xa,
the rainbow, was seen in the sky.</p>

<p>Therefore the Lenni-Lenapi watch for the rainbow,
because it means that the Mysterious One is no longer
angry.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg&nbsp;28]</a></span></p>
<h2>THE FIRST FIRE</h2>

<p class="subtitle">Cherokee</p>


<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>n the beginning there was no fire and the world
was cold. Then the Thunders, who lived up in
Galun&rsquo;lati, sent their lightning and put fire into
the bottom of a hollow sycamore tree which grew on an
island. The animals knew it was there because they
could see the smoke coming out at the top, but they
could not get to it on account of the water, so they held
a council to decide what to do. This was a long, long
time ago.</p>

<p>Every animal was anxious to go after the fire.
Raven offered. He was large and strong, so he was
sent first. He flew high and far across the water, and
lighted on the sycamore tree. There he perched,
wondering what to do next. Then he looked at himself.
The heat had scorched his feathers black. Raven
was so frightened he flew back across the water without
any fire.</p>

<p>Then little Wa-hu-hu, the Screech Owl, offered to
go. He flew high and far across the water and perched
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg&nbsp;29]</a></span>
upon a hollow tree. As he sat there looking into the
hollow tree, wondering what to do, a blast of hot air
came up and hurt his eyes. Screech Owl was frightened.
He flew back as best he could, because he could
hardly see. That is why his eyes are red even to this
day.</p>

<p>Then Hooting Owl and the Horned Owl went, but
by the time they reached the hollow tree, the fire was
blazing so fiercely that the smoke nearly blinded them.
The ashes carried up by the breeze made white rings
around their eyes. So they had to come home without
fire. Therefore they have white rings around their
eyes.</p>

<p>None of the rest of the birds would go to the fire.
Then Uk-su-hi, the racer snake, said he would go
through the water and bring back fire. He swam to
the island and crawled through the grass to the tree.
Then he went into the tree by a small hole at the bottom.
But the heat and smoke were dreadful. The
ground at the bottom of the tree was covered with hot
ashes. The racer darted back and forth trying to get
off the ashes, and at last managed to escape through the
same hole by which he had entered. But his body had
been burned black. Therefore he is now the black
racer. And that is why the black racer darts around
and doubles on his track as if trying to escape.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg&nbsp;30]</a></span>
Then great Blacksnake, &ldquo;The Climber,&rdquo; offered to
go for fire. He was much larger than the black racer.
Blacksnake swam over to the island and climbed up the
tree on the outside, as the blacksnake always does, but
when he put his head down into the hole the smoke
choked him so that he fell into the burning stump.
Before he could climb out, he, too, was burned black.</p>

<p>So the birds, and the animals, and the snakes held
another council. The world was still very cold. There
was no fire. But all the birds, and the snakes, and all
the four-footed animals refused to go for fire. They
were all afraid of the burning sycamore.</p>

<p>Then Water Spider said she would go. This is not
the water spider that looks like a mosquito, but the
other one&mdash;the one with black downy hair and red
stripes on her body. She could run on top of the water,
or dive to the bottom.</p>

<p>The animals said, &ldquo;How can you bring back fire?&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Water Spider spun a thread from her body and
wove it into a <i>tusti</i> bowl which she fastened on her back.
Then she swam over to the island and through the grass
to the fire. Water Spider put one little coal of fire into
her bowl, and then swam back with it.</p>

<p>That is how fire came to the world. And that is
why Water Spider has a <i>tusti</i> bowl on her back.</p>

<h2>THE ANCESTORS OF PEOPLE</h2>

<p class="subtitle">Osage</p>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>here are people who come from under the
water. They lived in the water weeds that
hang down, all green, into the water. They
have leaves upon their stems. Now the water people
lived in shells. The shells were their houses and kept
the water out.</p>

<p>There were other animals who lived under the earth.
Cougar lived under the earth, and bear, and buffalo.
These creatures came up out of the ground. Then the
shell people came up to the earth also; and the sky
people came down. So all these three peoples lived
together. They are the fathers of the people who live
on the earth today.</p>

<h2>ORIGIN OF STRAWBERRIES</h2>

<p class="subtitle">Cherokee</p>


<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>hen the world was new, there was one man
and one woman. They were happy; then
they quarreled. At last the woman left the
man and began to walk away toward the Sunland,
the Eastland. The man followed. He felt sorry, but
the woman walked straight on. She did not look back.</p>

<p>Then Sun, the great Apportioner, was sorry for the
man. He said,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you still angry with your wife?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The man said, &ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sun said, &ldquo;Would you like to have her come back
to you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the man.</p>

<p>So Sun made a great patch of huckleberries which
he placed in front of the woman&rsquo;s trail. She passed
them without paying any attention to them. Then Sun
made a clump of blackberry bushes and put those in
front of her trail. The woman walked on. Then Sun
created beautiful service-berry bushes which stood
beside the trail. Still the woman walked on.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg&nbsp;33]</a></span>
So Sun made other fruits and berries. But the
woman did not look at them.</p>

<p>Then Sun created a patch of beautiful ripe strawberries.
They were the first strawberries. When the
woman saw those, she stopped to gather a few. As
she gathered them, she turned her face toward the west.
Then she remembered the man. She turned to the
Sunland but could not go on. She could not go any
further.</p>

<p>Then the woman picked some of the strawberries and
started back on her trail, away from the Sunland. So
her husband met her, and they went back together.</p>

<h2>SACRED LEGEND</h2>

<p class="subtitle">Omaha</p>


<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>n the beginning the people were in water. They
opened their eyes, but they could see nothing. As
the people came out of the water, they first saw the
daylight. They had no clothing. Then they took
weeds and grasses and from them wove clothing.</p>

<p>The people lived near a large body of water; it was
in a wooded country where there was game. The men
hunted the deer with clubs; they did not know the use
of the bow. The people wandered about the shores of
the great water. They were poor and cold. The
people thought, &ldquo;What shall we do to help ourselves?&rdquo;
So they began chipping stones. They found a bluish
stone that was easily flaked and chipped; so they made
knives and arrowheads out of it. But they were still
poor and cold. They thought, &ldquo;What shall we do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then a man found an elm root that was very dry.
He dug a hole in it and put a stick in and rubbed it.
Then smoke came. He smelled it. Then the people
smelled it and came near. Others helped him to rub.
At last a spark came. They blew this into a flame.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg&nbsp;35]</a></span>
Thus fire came to warm the people and to cook their
food.</p>

<p>After this the people built grass houses; they cut the
grass with the shoulder blade of a deer. Now the people
had fire and ate their meat roasted. Then they
grew tired of roast meat. They thought, &ldquo;How shall
we cook our meat differently?&rdquo;</p>

<p>A man found a piece of clay that stuck well together.
Then he brought sand to mix with it. Then he molded
it as a pot. Then he gathered grass until he had a large
heap of it; he put the clay pot into the midst of the
grass and set it on fire. This made the clay hard.
After a time he put water into the pot; the water did
not leak out. This was good. So he put water into
it and then meat into it, and put the pot over the fire.
Thus the people had boiled meat to eat.</p>

<p>Now their grass coverings would grow fuzzy and
drop off. It was hard to gather and keep these coverings.
The people were not satisfied. Again they
thought, &ldquo;What can we do to have something different
to wear?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Before this, they had been throwing away the hides
from the game which they killed. But now they took
their stone knives to scrape down the hides and make
them thin. They rubbed the hides with grass and with
their hands to make them soft. Then they used the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg&nbsp;36]</a></span>
hides for clothing. Now they had clothing and were
warm.</p>

<p>Now the women had to break the dry wood to keep
up the fires. They had no tools. So the men made a
stone ax with a groove. Then they put a handle on the
grooved stone and fastened it with rawhide. This was
used. Then they wanted something better to break
the wood. So they made wedges of stone.</p>

<p>Now the grass shelter came to pieces easily. Then
the people thought, &ldquo;What shall we do? How can
we get something that will not come to pieces?&rdquo; Then
they tried putting skins on poles.</p>

<p>First they tried deerskins. But they were too small.
They tried elk skins. But they became hard and stiff
in the rain and sun. Then they did not try skins longer.
They used bark to cover the poles of their tepees.</p>

<p>But the bark houses were not warm. Then the people
took the leg bone of the deer and splintered it So they
made sharp pieces for awls. Then they took buffalo
skins and sinews, and with the awl they fastened the
skins together. So they made comfortable covers for
their tepees.</p>

<p>Then a man wandered around a long time. One day
he found some small pieces of something which were
white, and red, and blue. He thought they must be
something of great value, so he hid them in a mound of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg&nbsp;37]</a></span>
earth. Now one day he went to see if they were safe.
Behold! When he came to the mound, green stalks
were growing out of it. And on the stalks were small
kernels of white, and red, and blue. Behold! It was
corn. Then the man took the corn, and gave it to the
people. They tried it for food. They found it good,
and have ever since called it their life.</p>

<p>Now when the people found the corn good, they
thought to hide it in mounds as the first man had done.
So they took the shoulder blade of an elk and made
mounds. Then they hid the corn in it. So the corn
grew and the people had food.</p>

<p>Now as the people wandered around, they came to
a forest where the birch trees grew. There was a great
lake there. Then they made canoes of birch bark.
They traveled in them on the water. Then a man
found two young animals. He carried them home.
He fed them so they grew bigger. Then he made a
harness which he placed upon them and fastened it to
poles. So these animals became burden bearers. Before
that, every burden had to be carried on the back.
Now the dogs helped the people.</p>

<h2>THE LEGEND OF THE PEACE PIPES</h2>

<p class="subtitle">Omaha</p>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>he people came across a great water on logs
tied together. They pitched their tents on the
shore. Then they thought to make for themselves
certain bounds within which they were to live
and rules which should govern them. They cleared a
space of grass and weeds so they could see each other&rsquo;s
faces. They sat down and there was no obstruction
between them.</p>

<p>While they were holding a council, an owl hooted
in the trees near by. The leader said, &ldquo;That bird is
to take part in our council. He calls to us. He offers
us his aid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Immediately afterward they heard a woodpecker.
He knocked against the trees. The leader said, &ldquo;That
bird calls to us. He offers us his aid. He will take
part in our council.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then the chief appointed a man as servant. He said,
&ldquo;Go into the woods and get an ash sapling.&rdquo; The
servant came back with a sapling having a rough
bark.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg&nbsp;39]</a></span>
&ldquo;We do not want that,&rdquo; said the leader. &ldquo;Go again
and get a sapling with a smooth bark, bluish in color
at the joint where a branch comes.&rdquo; So the servant
went out, and came back with a sapling of the kind
described.</p>

<p>When the leader took up the sapling, an eagle came
and soared about the council which was sitting in the
grass. He dropped a downy feather; it fell. It fell
in the center of the cleared space. Now this was the
white eagle. The chief said, &ldquo;This is not what we
want,&rdquo; so the white eagle passed on.</p>

<p>Then the bald eagle came swooping down, as
though attacking its prey. It balanced itself on its
wings directly over the cleared space. It uttered fierce
cries, and dropped one of its downy feathers, which
stood on the ground as the other eagle&rsquo;s feather had
done. The chief said, &ldquo;This is not what we want.&rdquo; So
the bald eagle passed on.</p>

<p>Then came the spotted eagle, and soared over the
council, and dropped its feather as the others had done.
The chief said, &ldquo;This is not what we want,&rdquo; and the
spotted eagle passed on.</p>

<p>Then the imperial eagle, the eagle with the fantail,
came, and soared over the people. It dropped a downy
feather which stood upright in the center of the cleared
space. The chief said, &ldquo;This is what we want.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg&nbsp;40]</a></span>
So the feathers of this eagle were used in making
the peace pipes, together with the feathers of the owl
and woodpecker, and with other things. These peace
pipes were to be used in forming friendly relations
with other tribes.</p>

<p>When the peace pipes were made, seven other pipes
were made for keeping peace within the tribe. One
pipe was to prevent revenge. If one man should kill
another, the chief took this pipe to the relatives and
offered it to them. If the relatives of the dead man
refused to accept it, it was offered again. It was offered
four times. If it was refused four times, the chief said,
&ldquo;Well, you must take the consequences. We will do
nothing, and you cannot now ask to see the pipes.&rdquo; He
meant if they took revenge and any trouble came to
them, they could not ask for help or for mercy.</p>

<p>Each band had its own pipe.</p>

<h2>A TRADITION OF THE CALUMET</h2>

<p class="subtitle">Lenni-Lenapi</p>


<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>n the days of the old men, far to the north there
lived a nation with many villages. Their warriors
were as many as the buffalo herds on the plains
toward the Darkening Land. Their tepees were many
on the shores of a beautiful lake and along wide rivers.</p>

<p>Then the Mysterious One, whose voice is in the
clouds, told the chiefs of a great nation, also of many
villages, which hunted through all the country from
the Big Water in the sunrise to the mountains in the
Darkening Land.</p>

<p>Then the chiefs and the old men held a council.
Runners came from many villages to the great council.
And the council voice was to go to the great nation
to the south, the nation with many villages, and bring
back scalps and horses.</p>

<p>So the chiefs and warriors went out, one by one.
Then runners were sent to all the villages, ordering
the chiefs to dance the scalp dance.</p>

<p>Suddenly there came through the sky a great white
bird. It came from the forest, and flew into the village
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg&nbsp;42]</a></span>
of the great chief. It rested above the head of the
chief&rsquo;s daughter.</p>

<p>Then the chief&rsquo;s daughter heard a voice in her heart.
The voice said, &ldquo;Call all the chiefs and warriors together.
Tell them the Mysterious One is sad because
they seek the scalps of the Lenni-Lenapi, the First
People. Tell the warriors they must wash their hands
in the blood of a young fawn. They must go with
many presents to the First People. They must carry
to the First People Hobowakan, the calumet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thus the First People and the mighty people with
many villages on the shore of the lake smoked together
the pipe of council. So there was peace.</p>

<h2>THE SACRED POLE</h2>

<p class="subtitle">Omaha</p>


<p><span class="dropcap">A</span> young man who had been wandering came
back to his village. When he reached his
home he said, &ldquo;Father, I have seen a wonderful
tree.&rdquo; Then he told his father about it. The
old man was silent because all was not yet settled
between the tribes. The Cheyenne, the Arikara, the
Omaha, Ponca, and Iowa were having a great council,
so as to adopt rules concerning the hunting of game,
and of peace, and war.</p>

<p>After a while, the young man went to visit the tree.
When he reached home, he told his father again of it.
The old man was silent, for the chiefs were still holding
their council. At last, when the council was over and
the rules decided upon, the old man sent for the chiefs.
He said, &ldquo;My son has seen a wonderful tree. The
Thunder Birds come and go upon this tree. They
make a trail of fire which leaves four paths on the
burnt grass that stretch towards the Four Winds.
When the Thunder Birds alight upon the tree, it
bursts into flame. The fire mounts to the top. The
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg&nbsp;44]</a></span>
tree stands burning, but no one can see the fire except
at night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When the chiefs heard this tale, they sent runners
to see what this tree might be. The runners came back
and told the same story. In the night they had seen
the tree burning as it stood. Then all the people held
a council as to what this might mean. The chiefs said,
&ldquo;We shall run for it. Put on your ornaments and prepare
as if for battle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The warriors painted themselves as if for war. They
put on their ornaments. They set out for the tree,
which stood near a lake. They ran as if it were a race
to attack the enemy. All the men ran. A Ponca was
the first to reach the tree and he struck it as if it were
an enemy.</p>

<p>Then they cut the tree down. Four men, walking in
a straight line, carried it on their shoulders to the
village. The chiefs for four nights sang the songs made
in honor of the tree. They held a council about the
tree. A tent was made for it, and it was set up in the
circle of lodges. The chiefs worked upon it; they
trimmed it and called it a human being. They made
a basket of twigs and feathers and tied it half way up
the tree. Then they said, &ldquo;It has no hair!&rdquo; So they
sent out to get a large scalp lock and they put it on top
of Pole for hair. Afterwards the chiefs told the criers
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg&nbsp;45]</a></span>
to tell the people that when Pole was completed they
should see it.</p>

<p>Then they painted Pole and set it up before the tent.
They leaned it on a crotched stick. Then they called
all the people and all the people came. Men, women,
and children came.</p>

<p>When they were all together, the chiefs said, &ldquo;This
is a mystery. Whenever we meet with trouble, we shall
bring all our prayers to Pole. We shall make offerings
to him. We shall ask him for what we need. When
we ask anything, we must make gifts. If anyone desires
to become a chief, he shall make presents to the
Keepers of the Pole, and they shall give him authority
to be a chief.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When all was finished the people said, &ldquo;Let us
appoint a time when we shall again paint Pole; when
we shall act before him the battles we have fought.&rdquo;
So they fixed the time in the moon when the buffaloes
bellow.</p>

<h2>IKTO AND THE THUNDERS</h2>

<p class="subtitle">Teton</p>


<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>kto once stood on the bank of a stream across
which he could not swim. He stood on the bank
and thought. Then he sang:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I stand,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Thinking often,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Oh, that I might reach the other side.</span><br />
</div>
</div>

<p>Just then a long Something passed, swimming against
the current. When it reached Ikto, it said,</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will take you across, but you must not lift your
head above the water. Should you notice even a small
cloud, warn me at once, as I must go under the water.
If you see a small cloud, you must say, &lsquo;Younger
brother, your grandfather is coming.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Before the other bank was reached, Ikto looked up.
He saw a small cloud and said, &ldquo;Younger brother, your
grandfather is coming.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a sudden commotion. When Ikto became
conscious again, the Thunder Beings were roaring, and
the water was dashing high, but the monster had
vanished.</p>

<h2>THE THUNDER BIRD</h2>

<p class="subtitle">Comanche</p>


<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>n the olden times, a hunter once shot at a large
bird which was flying above him. It fell to the
ground. It was so large he was afraid to go to it
alone, so he went back to the camp for others.</p>

<p>When they came back to the place where the bird
had been shot, thunder was rolling through the ravine.
Flashes of lightning showed the place where the bird
lay. They came nearer. Then the lightning flashed
so that they could not see the bird. One flash killed
a hunter.</p>

<p>The other Indians fled back to the camp. They knew
it was the Thunder Bird.</p>

<p>Once the Thunder Bird, in the days of the grandfathers,
came down to the ground and alighted there.
You may know that is so, because the grass remains
burned off a large space, and the outlines are those of
a large bird with outspread wings.</p>

<h2>THE THUNDER BIRD</h2>

<p class="subtitle">Assiniboin</p>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>he Sioux, or Dakotas, of whom the Assiniboins
are a branch, pretend that thunder is
an enormous bird, and that the muffled
sound of the distant thunder is caused by a countless
number of young birds! The great bird, they say,
gives the first sound, and the young ones repeat it; this
is the cause of the reverberations. The Sioux declare
that the young Thunders do all the mischief, like boys
who will not listen to good advice; but the old
Thunder, or big bird, is wise and excellent; he never
kills or injures any one!</p>

<h2>ORIGIN OF THE BUFFALO</h2>

<p class="subtitle">Teton</p>


<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>n the days of the grandfathers, buffaloes lived
under the earth. In the olden times, they say, a
man who was journeying came to a hill where
there were many holes in the ground. He entered one
of them. When he had gone inside he found buffalo
chips and buffalo tracks on all sides. He found also
buffalo hairs where the buffaloes had rubbed against
the walls. These were the real buffaloes and they lived
under the ground. Afterwards some of them came to
the surface of the earth and lived there. Then the
herds on the earth increased.</p>

<p>These buffaloes had many lodges and there they
raised their children. They did many strange things.
Therefore when a man escapes being wounded by an
enemy, people say he has seen the buffaloes in his
dreams, and they have helped him.</p>

<p>Men who dream of the buffaloes act like them and
dance the buffalo-bull dance. Then the man who acts
the buffalo has a real buffalo inside of him, people say,
a little hard ball near the shoulder blade; and therefore
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg&nbsp;54]</a></span>
he is very hard to kill. No matter how often he is
wounded, he does not die.</p>

<p>People know that the buffaloes live in earth lodges;
so they never dance the buffalo dance vainly.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg&nbsp;55]</a></span></p>
<h2>THE BUFFALO BEING</h2>

<p class="subtitle">Teton</p>


<p><span class="dropcap">O</span>nce upon a time, a Buffalo Being attacked a
party of Indians. He killed one of them,
but the others ran away and climbed a tree.
The Buffalo Being followed them and rushed at the
tree. He rushed many times, knocking off piece after
piece of the tree, until very little was left.</p>

<p>Then the frightened Indians lighted some tinder, and
threw it far off into the tall grass. The fire scorched
the Buffalo Being&rsquo;s eyes, and injured his horns. The
hard part of the horn slipped off, leaving only the
softer part, so that he could no longer injure any one.</p>

<p>But the Buffalo Being was still dangerous. At last
one of the Indians slipped down the tree, with his bow
and arrow. He killed the Buffalo Being. Then all the
men came down the tree and skinned the animal and
cut up the flesh. Into the buffalo-skin robe they placed
the body of the dead Indian. But suddenly another
Buffalo Being appeared. The Indians again climbed
the tree. But this Being only walked four times around
the dead Indian. Then he said, &ldquo;Arise to your feet.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg&nbsp;56]</a></span>
At once the dead man came to life. The Buffalo
Being said to him, &ldquo;Hereafter you shall be mysterious.
The sun, the moons, the four winds, day and night shall

<p>Then it was so. The Indian could take the form of
a fine plume, which was blown against a tree. It would
stick to the tree and wave many times in the breeze.</p>

<h2>THE YOUTH AND THE UNDERGROUND PEOPLE</h2>

<p class="subtitle">Omaha</p>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>here were some villages which were very
populous. The chief&rsquo;s son and his daughter
were unmarried. There were two sons. They
surrounded the herds of buffaloes. They used to kill
buffaloes.</p>

<p>One of the sons of this chief attacked a buffalo
when far apart from the rest. He shot it; but the buffalo
had gone out of sight into the ground. The man
and his horse, too, went headlong; but the buffalo went
down first.</p>

<p>Now the father sent out criers. &ldquo;He says that his
son reached the buffaloes, but he has not come home.
He says that ye who have seen his son will please tell
it,&rdquo; shouted the criers.</p>

<p>One said he had seen him. &ldquo;I saw him very distinctly.
He went in pursuit. Perhaps he went headlong
into a sunken place, for when on very level ground
he vanished altogether. I did not see him again,&rdquo; he
said.</p>

<p>The father commanded the people to join him in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg&nbsp;58]</a></span>
seeking his son. When the man who had seen him
said, &ldquo;It was just here,&rdquo; the people scattered far and
wide, seeking the chief&rsquo;s son. All the people sought
him. Behold, he had gone down the pit some time
before. The buffalo had gone down, having kicked
off a piece of the soil. The horse, too, had gone down,
having kicked off a piece of the soil.</p>

<p>There was no trail beyond the pit. All the people
went directly to it, without hesitation.</p>

<p>The pit was very large and extended far downward.
The chief spoke of removing the village there, at once.
So there they camped. They camped around the pit.</p>

<p>Then the chief implored the young men and those
who had been his friends. If there was one man who
was stout-hearted, one who had a firm heart, the father
wished him to enter the pit and go after the young
man. So he implored them.</p>

<p>At length one rode round and round the village.
Then he promised to enter the pit and go after the missing
son.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell his father. He must also collect cords,&rdquo; he
said.</p>

<p>Having cut buffalo hides in strips, he collected the
cords.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Make a round piece of skin for me, and tie the long
line of cord to it,&rdquo; he said. So they finished it.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg&nbsp;59]</a></span>
&ldquo;Now it matters not to what place I go, I will put
the body in the skin bucket. I go to take hold of him.
When I reach the ground at the bottom, I will pull
suddenly on the cord. When I pull on it many times,
you will draw it up.&rdquo; Thus he said.</p>

<p>At last he reached the ground inside the pit. It was
very dark. When he felt around in the dark, the buffalo
was lying alone, being killed by the fall. The
horse, too, was lying by itself, having been killed by
the fall. And the man lay apart from them, having
been killed by the fall.</p>

<p>Picking up the body of the chief&rsquo;s son, he put it in
the hollow skin. Then he pulled many times on the
cord.</p>

<p>But when the young man went down, strange to say,
he did not ask favors for himself. And they rejoiced
because he had put the chief&rsquo;s son in the hollow skin.
Having brought up the dead man they forgot the living
one.</p>

<p>Though he sat waiting for the hollow skin to
come down again, he was not drawn up. So he sat
wailing.</p>

<p>Now the chief had promised him his daughter to
go down into the pit. &ldquo;If you bring my son back,
you shall marry her,&rdquo; he had said.</p>

<p>The young man wandered about in the darkness. At
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg&nbsp;60]</a></span>
length when walking along the trail, he came suddenly
upon an old woman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Venerable woman, though this land is very difficult
to reach, I have come hither. I came to the hole
in the ground above. One person came hither, having
fallen into this pit. I came to take him back. They
have not drawn me up; and I have no way of going
back. Venerable woman, help me.&rdquo; So he spoke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is nothing that I can do to help you,&rdquo; she
said. &ldquo;A person is in that place, out of sight. Go
there. He is the one who will do it for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He went there. When he arrived, he knocked repeatedly
on the door. Though he stood hearing them speaking,
they did not open the door for him.</p>

<p>The woman said, &ldquo;Fie! A person has come. Open
the door for him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Behold! The man&rsquo;s child was dead, and therefore
he sat without speaking. He sat still, being sad. Then
the young man arrived within the lodge, the woman
having opened the door for him. Yet her husband sat
without speaking. The young man was impatient from
hunger. The husband questioned him:</p>

<p>&ldquo;From what place have you walked?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>The young man told his story. &ldquo;I walked up above,
but a man headed off the herd, and having fallen, he
came here. I came here to take him back. They did
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg&nbsp;61]</a></span>
not take me back; I have no way of going back. Help
me,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>The man said, &ldquo;We had a child, but it died. We
will treat you just like the child who died.&rdquo; He meant
he would adopt him. &ldquo;All things which I have are
yours,&rdquo; said the father.</p>

<p>The young man did not speak. He wished to go
homeward.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whatever you say I will do it for you,&rdquo; said the
father. &ldquo;Even if you desire to go homeward, it shall be
so,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>At last the young man spoke of going homeward.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you say, &lsquo;I will go homeward riding a horse of
such a color, O father!&rsquo; it shall be so,&rdquo; said the father.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fie!&rdquo; said the woman. &ldquo;Heretofore we were
deprived of our child. The young man who has just
come home is like him. Give him one thing which
you have.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I make you my child. I will give you something.
Whatever I desire I always make with it, when I wish
to have anything,&rdquo; said the father. He had a piece of
iron and when he wished anything he used to point at
the iron.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O father, I wish to go homeward riding a horse
with very white hair. I also desire a mule with very
white hair, and a good saddle,&rdquo; said the young man.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg&nbsp;62]</a></span>
&ldquo;Come, go there. Open the door of that stable.
When you wish to see us again, you shall see us. When
you will go homeward, you will say, &lsquo;Come, O father,
I desire to go homeward,&rsquo;&rdquo; said the father.</p>

<p>The young man went homeward. He made the rocks
open suddenly by pointing at them with the iron. He
went up, making the ground echo under the horse&rsquo;s
feet. When he pushed aside a very large rock which
was in his way, he found himself again on the surface
of the earth. The horse and mule were very sudden
in their movements. They shied at every step. They
sniffed the odor of a bad land.</p>

<p>The young man found his nation that he had left.
Behold! they had recently removed and departed.
After they waited some time for him to appear, they
had removed their camp and departed. The horse
and mule went along, fearing the sight of the old
camping ground. They followed the trail of the departing
village.</p>

<p>Then the young man saw two people on a large hill,
walking in the trail. They were the head chief and his
wife who were walking along, mourning for the dead.</p>

<p>They looked behind and said, &ldquo;Yonder comes one
on horseback, following the trail made by the departing
village.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He drew near. They sat waiting for him to appear.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg&nbsp;63]</a></span>
The horse and mule feared the sight of them; they
sniffed a bad odor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why! Of what nation are you?&rdquo; asked the chief.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is I,&rdquo; said the young man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But which one are you?&rdquo; said the chief.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your son went headlong into a pit when they surrounded
the herd,&rdquo; said the young man. &ldquo;And I went
down to get him. You did not bring me back. It is
I.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As he was very much changed, the old man
doubted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fie! Tell the truth about yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When they surrounded the herd, your son went
headlong as well as the buffalo, and he was killed by
falling into a pit. When you commanded them to get
him, they drew back through fear. I am he who went
to get him when you offered your daughter as a
reward,&rdquo; said the young man. &ldquo;I have hardly been
able to come again to the surface.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then they recognized him. The two men stood talking
together on the large hill. The chief&rsquo;s son looked
back from the camp.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why! The chief and his wife have come as far as
the large hill and a man on horseback has come, too.
He stands talking to them. I will go thither. Let me
see! I will go to see them.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg&nbsp;64]</a></span>
He went back on horseback and came to his father.</p>

<p>&ldquo;With what person do you talk?&rdquo; said the son.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why! He who went to get your elder brother has
come back!&rdquo; said the head chief.</p>

<p>They shook hands. And the head chief gave his
daughter to the young man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let all the men and chiefs assemble. Let all the
stout-hearted young men assemble. They can look at
my daughter&rsquo;s husband,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>They assembled. They came to see the young man
and brought the things they intended giving him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He says that he who went to get the man who was
killed by falling has come back. The chief says that
as he has made the young man his daughter&rsquo;s husband
you shall go to see the young man. He says that you
will take to him what things you wish to give him.
The chief says he will give thanks for them.&rdquo; So
shouted the crier.</p>

<p>All the young men and those who were brave and
generous went thither. They all gave him clothing and
good horses. His wife&rsquo;s father made him the head
chief.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Make ye a tent for him in the center,&rdquo; said the old
chief.</p>

<p>They set up a tent for him in the center. They finished
it.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg&nbsp;65]</a></span>
&ldquo;The people did not eat. As they sat waiting for
you to appear, the nation did not eat. You came back
when they were just removing camp,&rdquo; said the old
chief.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ho!&rdquo; said the one who had just reached home.
&ldquo;Let two old men go as criers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the criers shouted: &ldquo;The chiefs daughter&rsquo;s husband
says that you will rest tomorrow. He says you
will not go in any direction whatever.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The next day he commanded those who had come
back on horseback to act as scouts. And the scouts came
back very soon; because by means of the iron rod which
he had asked of his father, he made a great many buffaloes
very quickly. He spoke of surrounding them.
They shot down many of the buffaloes. He went to
take part in surrounding them.</p>

<p>His wife said, &ldquo;I desire to go to see them surround
the herd. I must go to see the buffaloes. When they
are killed, I will be quite likely to come back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When they killed the buffaloes she was coming back;
the wife stood on the hill. Her husband came to that
place.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Though I killed the buffaloes, they will cut them
up,&rdquo; he said. They who surrounded them reached
home.</p>

<p>Again they spoke of a buffalo hunt. &ldquo;The chief&rsquo;s
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg&nbsp;66]</a></span>
daughter&rsquo;s husband speaks indeed of sending them to
act as scouts,&rdquo; said the criers.</p>

<p>Again the herd of buffaloes had come to that country.
They surrounded them. Again they shot down many of them.</p>

<p>At last the son of the old head chief was in a bad
humor. He was in a bad humor because his sister&rsquo;s
husband had been made chief.</p>

<p>Now at night, the horse used to say to the young man,
&ldquo;O father, a man desires very much to kill us. It is
so every night.&rdquo; And after that at night the young man
used to take care of his horse and mule.</p>

<p>On the next day they surrounded the herd in the
land where the deed was done. It was just so again; a
great many buffaloes had been coming. At length the
son wished the buffaloes to trample his sister&rsquo;s husband
to death. When they attacked the buffaloes, he waved
his robe. Turning around in his course, he waved his
robe again. When the sister&rsquo;s husband went right in
among the buffaloes, they closed in on him and he was
not seen at all.</p>

<p>The people said, &ldquo;The buffaloes have trampled to
death the chief&rsquo;s daughter&rsquo;s husband.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When the buffaloes trampled him to death, they scattered
and went homeward in every direction, moving
in long lines. And the people did not find any trace
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg&nbsp;67]</a></span>
whatever of what was done. They did not find the
horse. Even the man they did not find. When the buffaloes
killed him by trampling, the horse had gone
back to Him Who Made Things.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg&nbsp;68]</a></span></p>
<h2>THE BUFFALO AND THE GRIZZLY BEAR</h2>

<p class="subtitle">Omaha</p>


<p><span class="dropcap">G</span>rizzly Bear was going somewhere, following
the course of a stream, and at last he went
straight towards the headland. When he got in
sight, Buffalo Bull was standing beneath it. Grizzly
Bear retraced his steps, going again to the stream, following
its course until he got beyond the headland.
Then he drew near and peeped. He saw that Buffalo
Bull was very lean, and standing with his head bowed,
as if sluggish. So Grizzly Bear crawled up close to
him, made a rush, seized him by the hair of his head,
and pulled down his head. He turned Buffalo Bull
round and round, shaking him now and then, saying,
&ldquo;Speak! Speak! I have been coming to this place a
long time, and they say you have threatened to fight me.
Speak!&rdquo; Then he hit Buffalo Bull on the nose with
his open paw.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why!&rdquo; said Buffalo Bull, &ldquo;I have never threatened
to fight you, who have been coming to this country
so long.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not so! You have threatened to fight me.&rdquo;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg&nbsp;69]</a></span>
Letting go the buffalo&rsquo;s head, Grizzly Bear went
around and seized him by the tail, turning him round
and round. Then he left, but as he did so, he gave him
a hard blow with his open paw.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! you have caused me great
pain,&rdquo; said Buffalo Bull. Bobtailed Grizzly Bear
departed.</p>

<p>Buffalo Bull thought thus: &ldquo;Attack him! You too
have been just that sort of a person.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Grizzly Bear knew what he was thinking, so he said,
&ldquo;Why! what are you saying?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I said nothing,&rdquo; said Buffalo Bull.</p>

<p>Then Grizzly Bear came back. He seized Buffalo
Bull by the tail, pulling him round and round. Then
he seized him by the horns, pulling his head round and
round. Then he seized him again by the tail and hit
him again with the open paw. Again Grizzly Bear
departed. And again Buffalo Bull thought as he had
done before. Then Grizzly Bear came back and
treated Buffalo Bull as he had before.</p>

<p>Buffalo Bull stepped backward, throwing his tail
into the air.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why! Do not flee,&rdquo; said Grizzly Bear.</p>

<p>Buffalo threw himself down, and rolled over and
over. Then he continued backing, pawing the ground.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why! I say, do not flee,&rdquo; said Grizzly Bear.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg&nbsp;70]</a></span>
When Buffalo Bull backed, making ready to attack
him, Grizzly Bear thought he was scared.</p>

<p>Then Buffalo Bull ran towards Grizzly, puffing a
great deal. When he neared him, he rushed on him.
He sent Grizzly Bear flying through the air.</p>

<p>As Grizzly Bear came down towards the earth, Buffalo
Bull caught him on his horns and threw him into
the air again. When Grizzly Bear fell and lay on the
ground, Buffalo Bull made at him with his horns to
gore him, but just missed him. Grizzly Bear crawled
away slowly, with Buffalo Bull following him step by
step, thrusting at him now and then, though without
striking him. When Grizzly Bear came to a cliff, he
plunged over headlong, and landed in a thicket at the
foot. Buffalo Bull had run so fast he could not stop
at the edge where Grizzly Bear went over, but followed
the cliff for some distance. Then he came back and
stood with his tail partly raised. Grizzly Bear returned
to the bank and peeped.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Buffalo Bull,&rdquo; said Grizzly Bear. &ldquo;Let us be
friends. We are very much alike in disposition.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>MY FIRST BUFFALO HUNT<a name="FNanchor_G_7" id="FNanchor_G_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_G_7" class="fnanchor">[G]</a></h2>

<p class="subtitle">Omaha</p>


<p><span class="dropcap">I</span> went three times on the buffalo hunt. When
I was there the first time, I was small; therefore,
I did not shoot the buffaloes. But I used to take
care of the pack horses for those who surrounded the
herd. When they surrounded the herd at the very first,
I spoke of shooting at the buffaloes. But my father
said, &ldquo;Perhaps the horse might throw you suddenly,
and then the buffalo might gore you.&rdquo; And I was in
a bad humor.</p>

<p>My father went with me to the hill. We sat and
looked on them when they attacked the buffaloes. And
notwithstanding my father talked to me, I continued
there without talking to him. At length one man was
coming directly toward the tents in pursuit of a buffalo
bull. And the buffalo bull was savage. He attacked
the man now and then.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come! Go thither,&rdquo; said my father. I tied a lariat
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg&nbsp;72]</a></span>
on a large red mare that was very tall. And taking a
very light gun which my father had, I went over there.
When I arrived the buffalo bull was standing motionless.
The man said he was very glad that I had come.
The buffalo bull was savage. The man shot suddenly
at him with a bow and wounded him on the back. And
then he attacked us. The horse on which I was seated
leaped very far four times, and had gone off, throwing
me suddenly. When the buffalo bull had come very
close, he wheeled around and departed. So I failed
to shoot at him before he went. I reached home just
as my mother was scolding my father about me. When
the horse reached home with the bridle sticking to it,
she knew that I had been thrown. My father said nothing
at all, but sat laughing. Addressing me, he said,
&ldquo;Did you kill the buffalo bull?&rdquo; And I did not speak.</p>

<h2>BIRD OMENS</h2>

<p class="subtitle">Sioux</p>


<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>hen whippoorwills sing together at night,
&ldquo;<i>Hohin, hohin,</i>&rdquo; one says in reply, &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
If the birds stop talking at once, then the
person will die soon. But if the birds continue talking,
then the man will live a long time.</p>

<p>The gray screech owl foretells cold weather. When
the night is to be very cold, then the owl cries out;
it sounds just as if a person&rsquo;s teeth chattered. When the
owl cries out, all people wrap themselves in their thickest
robes; and they put plenty of wood on the fires.</p>

<p>The Ski-bi-bi-la is a small gray bird, with a black
head, and spotted on the breast. It lives in the woods,
and it answers a person who calls to it. When this
bird says, &ldquo;Has it returned?&rdquo; people are glad. They
know that spring is near. When a boy hears the bird
ask this question, he runs to his mother; she tells him
he must answer, &ldquo;No; it has not yet returned.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When the people first hear the cry of the nighthawk
in the spring, they begin to talk of hunting buffalo.
This is because when the hawk returns, the buffaloes
have become fat again and the birds bring the news.</p>

<p>All the birds flew to a great height. But Wren got
under the thick feathers of Eagle and sat there as Eagle
flew. When all the birds became wing-tired, they flew
down again; but Eagle flew still higher. When Eagle
had gone as far as he could, Wren flew still higher.</p>

<p>When all the birds reached the ground, Eagle alone
returned, after a great while. Behold! Wren only was
absent. So they awaited him. At last he returned.
Eagle had too highly been thinking of himself, being
sure of being made chief; and behold! Wren was made

<h2>THE EAGLE&rsquo;S REVENGE</h2>

<p class="subtitle">Cherokee</p>


<p><span class="dropcap">O</span>nce a hunter in the mountains heard a noise
at night like a rushing wind. He went outside
his tepee, and found an eagle was sitting
on the drying pole, feasting at the deer he had shot.
So he shot the eagle.</p>

<p>The next morning the hunter took the deer back to
the village. He told how he had shot the deer and
then the eagle. Therefore the chief sent out men to
bring in the eagle, and have an Eagle dance.</p>

<p>That night when they were dancing, there was a
<i>whoop</i> outside. A strange warrior walked into the
circle. He was not of that village. They thought he
had come from one of the other Cherokee villages.</p>

<p>This warrior told how he had killed a man. At the
end of the story, he yelled, &ldquo;<i>Hi!</i>&rdquo; One of the men
with rattles, who was leading the dance, fell dead.
The stranger sang of another deed. At the end he
yelled, &ldquo;<i>Hi!</i>&rdquo; Another rattler fell dead. The people
were frightened. But the stranger sang of another
great deed. Then again he yelled, &ldquo;<i>Hi!</i>&rdquo; Again a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg&nbsp;79]</a></span>
man with the rattles fell dead. So all seven men who
had rattles and who were leading the dance fell dead.
And the people were too frightened to leave the lodge
where they were dancing.</p>

<p>Then the stranger vanished into the darkness. Long
after they learned that the stranger was the brother of
the eagle that had been killed.</p>

<h2>THE RACE BETWEEN HUMMING BIRD AND CRANE</h2>

<p class="subtitle">Cherokee</p>


<p><span class="dropcap">H</span>umming Bird and Crane were both in
love with a pretty woman. She liked Humming
Bird, who was handsome. Crane was
ugly, but he would not give up the pretty woman. So
at last to get rid of him, she told them they must have
a race, and that she would marry the winner. Now
Humming Bird flew like a flash of light; but Crane
was heavy and slow.</p>

<p>The birds started from the woman&rsquo;s house to fly
around the world to the beginning. Humming Bird
flew off like an arrow. He flew all day and when he
stopped to roost he was far ahead.</p>

<p>Crane flew heavily, but he flew all night long. He
stopped at daylight at a creek to rest. Humming Bird
waked up, and flew on again, and soon he reached a
creek, and behold! there was Crane, spearing tadpoles
with his long bill. Humming Bird flew on.</p>

<p>Soon Crane started on and flew all night as before.
Humming Bird slept on his roost.</p>

<p>Next morning Humming Bird flew on and Crane
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg&nbsp;81]</a></span>
was far, far ahead. The fourth day, Crane was spearing
tadpoles for dinner when Humming Bird caught
up with him. By the seventh day Crane was a whole
night&rsquo;s travel ahead. At last he reached the beginning
again. He stopped at the creek and preened his
feathers, and then in the early morning went to the
woman&rsquo;s house. Humming Bird was far, far behind.</p>

<p>But the woman declared she would not marry so
ugly a man as Crane. Therefore she remained single.</p>

<h2>RABBIT AND THE TURKEYS</h2>

<p class="subtitle">Omaha</p>


<p><span class="dropcap">R</span>abbit was going somewhere. At length he
reached a place where there were wild
Turkeys.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; said Rabbit. &ldquo;I will sing dancing songs
for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Turkeys went to him saying, &ldquo;Oho! Rabbit will
sing dancing songs for us!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When I sing for you, you larger ones must go
around the circle next to me. Beware lest you open
your eyes. Should one of you open his eyes, your eyes
shall be red,&rdquo; said Rabbit.</p>

<p>Then he began to sing,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Alas for the gazer!</span><br />
<span class="i0">Eyes red! Eyes red!</span><br />
<span class="i0">Spread out your tails!</span><br />
<span class="i0">Spread out your tails!</span><br />
</div>
</div>

<p>Whenever a large Turkey came near, Rabbit seized
it and put it in his bag. While he was putting in a
Turkey, another one opened his eyes a little, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg&nbsp;83]</a></span>
exclaimed, &ldquo;Why! He has captured nearly all of us
large ones!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Off they all flew with a whirring sound.</p>

<p>Rabbit took home those he had in his bag, saying
to his grandmother, &ldquo;Do not look at what is in that
bag! I have brought it home on my back and I wish
you to guard it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then he went out to cut spits on which to roast the
Turkeys. When the old woman was alone, she thought,
&ldquo;What could he have brought home on his back?&rdquo;
So she untied the bag, and when she looked in out flew
all the Turkeys, hitting their wings hard against the
grass lodge, and flying out the smoke hole. The old
woman barely killed one by hitting it. At length
Rabbit came home.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh I have inflicted a severe injury on my grandchild,&rdquo;
she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Really,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;Grandmother, I told you
not to look at it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But that is why Turkeys have red eyes.</p>

<h2>UNKTOMI AND THE BAD SONGS</h2>

<p class="subtitle">Dakota</p>


<p><span class="dropcap">U</span>nktomi was going along; his way lay along
by the side of a lake. Out on the lake there
were a great many ducks, geese, and swans
swimming. When Unktomi saw them he went backward
out of sight, and picking some grass, bound it up
in a bundle. He placed this on his back and so went
again along by the side of the lake.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Unktomi, what are you carrying?&rdquo; asked the ducks
and the geese and the swans.</p>

<p>&ldquo;These are bad songs I am carrying,&rdquo; said Unktomi.</p>

<p>The ducks said, &ldquo;Unktomi, sing for us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Unktomi replied, &ldquo;But the songs are very bad.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the ducks insisted upon it. Then Unktomi said,
&ldquo;Make a grass lodge.&rdquo; So they went to work and made
a large grass lodge.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, let all the ducks, geese, and swans gather
inside the lodge and I will sing for you,&rdquo; said Unktomi.
So all the ducks and the geese and the swans gathered
inside and filled the grass lodge. Then Unktomi took
his place at the door of the lodge and said, &ldquo;If I sing
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg&nbsp;85]</a></span>
for you, no one must look, for that is the meaning of
the song.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then he began to sing,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Dance with your eyes shut;</span><br />
<span class="i0">If you open your eyes</span><br />
<span class="i0">Your eyes shall be red!</span><br />
<span class="i0">Your eyes shall be red!</span><br />
</div>
</div>

<p>When he said and sang this, the geese, ducks, and
swans danced with their eyes shut. Then Unktomi rose
up and said,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I even, even I</span><br />
<span class="i0">Follow in my own;</span><br />
<span class="i0">I even, even I,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Follow in my own.</span><br />
</div>
</div>

<p>So they all gabbled as they danced, and Unktomi,
dancing among them, commenced twisting off the necks
of the fattest of the geese and ducks and swans. But
when he tried to twist off the neck of a large swan and
could not, he only made him squawk. Then a small
duck, called Skiska, partly opened his eyes. He saw
Unktomi try to break the swan&rsquo;s neck, and he made an
outcry:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Look ye, look ye!</span><br />
<span class="i0">Unktomi will destroy us all.</span><br />
<span class="i0">Look ye, look ye!</span><br />
</div>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg&nbsp;86]</a></span>
At once they all opened their eyes and attempted to
go out. But Unktomi threw himself in the doorway
and tried to stop them. They rushed upon him with
their feet and wings, and smote him and knocked him
over, walking on his stomach, and leaving him as
though dead. Then Unktomi came to life, and got up,
and looked around.</p>

<p>But they say that the Wood Duck, which looked
first, had his eyes made red.</p>

<p>Then Unktomi gathered up the ducks and geese and
swans he had killed and carried them on his back. He
came to a river and traveled along by the side of it
till he came to a long, straight place where he stopped
to boil his kettle. He put all the ducks and geese and
swans whose necks he had twisted into the kettle, and
set it on the fire to boil, and then he lay down to sleep.</p>

<p>As he lay there, curled up on the bank of the river,
he said, &ldquo;Mionze [familiar spirit], if anyone comes
you wake me up.&rdquo; So he slept.</p>

<p>Now a mink came paddling along on the river, and
coming close to Unktomi&rsquo;s boiling place, saw him lying
fast asleep. Then he went there. While Unktomi
slept, he took out all the boiling meat and ate it up,
putting the bones back into the kettle. Then Unktomi
waked up. He sat up and saw no one.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps my boiling is cooked for me,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg&nbsp;87]</a></span>
He took the kettle off the fire. He poked a stick into
it and found only bones. Then he said, &ldquo;Indeed, the
meat has all fallen off.&rdquo; So he took a spoon and dipped
it out; nothing was there but bones.</p>

<p>This is the story of Unktomi and the Bad Songs.</p>

<h2>HOW THE PHEASANT BEAT CORN</h2>

<p class="subtitle">Cherokee</p>


<p><span class="dropcap">O</span>nce Pheasant saw a woman beating corn in a
wooden mortar in front of her lodge.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can do that, too,&rdquo; said Pheasant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe you,&rdquo; said the woman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I can,&rdquo; said Pheasant. So Pheasant went into
the woods behind the lodge. He flew to a hollow log
and drummed with his wings until the people thought
he really was beating corn.</p>

<p>That is why the Indians have the Pheasant dance, as
a part of the Green-corn dance.</p>

<h2>WHY THE TURKEY GOBBLES</h2>

<p class="subtitle">Cherokee</p>


<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>n the old days, Grouse had a good voice and
Turkey had none. Therefore Turkey asked
Grouse to teach him. But Grouse wanted pay,
so Turkey promised to give him some feathers for a
collar. That is how the Grouse got his collar of turkey
feathers.</p>

<p>So the Grouse began to teach Turkey. At last Grouse
said, &ldquo;Now you must try your voice. You must
halloo.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Turkey said, &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Grouse said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll stand on this hollow log, and
when I tap on it, you must halloo as loudly as you can.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Grouse climbed upon a log, ready to tap on it,
but when he did so, Turkey became so excited that
when he opened his mouth, he only said, &ldquo;<i>Gobble, gobble,
gobble!</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>That is why the Turkey gobbles whenever he hears a
noise.</p>

<h2>OMAHA BELIEFS</h2>

<p class="subtitle">Omaha</p>


<p><span class="dropcap">S</span>ong was an integral part of Omaha life.
Through song, the Omaha approached the mysterious
Wakoda; through song he voiced his
emotions, both individual and social; through song he
embodied feelings and aspirations that eluded expression
in words. In one of their ceremonies, the Wa&acute; wa,
&ldquo;to sing for somebody,&rdquo; songs are one of the chief
characteristics.</p>

<p>In this ceremony, the eagle is &ldquo;Mother.&rdquo; She calls
to her nestlings and upon her strong wings she bears
the message of peace. Peace and its symbol, the clear,
cloudless sky, are the theme of the principal songs.
The curlew, in the early morning, stretches its neck and
its wing as it sits on the roost, and utters a long note.
The sound is considered an indication that the day will
be cloudless.</p>

<p>Green represents the verdure of the earth; blue is
the color of the sky; red is the color of the sun, typifying
life. The eagle is the bird of tireless strength.
The owl represents night, and the woodpecker the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg&nbsp;91]</a></span>
day and sun. These two birds also stand for life and
death.</p>

<p>Wakoda gives to man the sunshine, the clear sky
from which all storms, all clouds are absent; in the
Wa&acute; wa ceremony, they stand for peace. In this connection,
black storm clouds with their thunder and
lightning are emblematic of war.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg&nbsp;92]</a></span></p>
<h2>PAWNEE BELIEFS</h2>

<p class="subtitle">Pawnee</p>


<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>t the creation of the world, lesser powers
were made, because Tira&rsquo;wa-tius, the Mighty Power,
could not come near to man, or be seen or
felt by him. These lesser powers dwell in the great
circle of the sky. One is North Star; another is Brown
Eagle. The Winds were the first of the lesser powers
to come near man. Therefore, when man calls for aid,
he calls first to the Winds. They stand at the four
points, and guard the four paths down which the lesser
powers come when they help mankind. The Winds are
always near us, by day and by night.</p>

<p>The Sun is one of these powers. It comes from the
mighty power above; therefore it has great strength.</p>

<p>Mother Earth is another power. She is very near
to man. From her we get food; upon her we lie down.
We live and walk on her. We could not exist without
Mother Earth, without Sun, and without the Winds.</p>

<p>Water is another lesser power. Water is necessary
to mankind.</p>

<p>Fire made by rubbing two sticks together is sacred.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg&nbsp;93]</a></span>
It comes direct from the power granted Toharu, vegetation,
in answer to man&rsquo;s prayer as he rubs the sticks.
When the flame leaps from the glowing wood, it is
the word of the fire. The power has come near.</p>

<p>Blue is the color of the sky, the dwelling place of
Tira&acute; wahut, the circle of powers which watch over
man. As a man paints the blue stick he sings.</p>

<p>Red is the color of the sun. Green is the color of
Mother Earth.</p>

<p>Eagle is the chief of day; Owl is chief of the night;
Woodpecker is chief of the trees; Duck is chief of
the water.</p>

<p>The ear of corn represents the supernatural power
that dwells in the earth, which brings forth the food
that sustains life; there corn is spoken of as <i>h&rsquo;Atira</i>,
&ldquo;mother breathing forth life.&rdquo; The power which
dwells in the earth, which enables it to give life to all
growing things, comes from above. Therefore, in the
Hako, the Pawnee ceremony, the ear of corn is painted
with blue.</p>

<p>The wildcat was made to live in the forest. He has
much skill and ingenuity. The wildcat shows us we
must think, must use tact, must be shrewd when we set
out to do anything. The wildcat is one of the sacred
animals.</p>

<p>Trees grow along the banks of the streams; we can
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg&nbsp;94]</a></span>
see them at a distance, like a long line, and we can see
the river glistening in the sunlight in its length. We
sing to the river, and when we come nearer and see
the water and hear it rippling along, then we sing to
the water, the water that ripples as it runs.</p>

<p>Hills were made by Tira&rsquo;wa. We ascend hills when
we go away alone to pray. From the top of a hill we
can look over the country to see if there are enemies
in sight, or if any danger is near us. We can see if
we are to meet friends. The hills help man, so we sing
to them.</p>

<h2>OLD-WOMAN-WHO-NEVER-DIES</h2>

<p class="subtitle">Mandan</p>


<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>n the sun lives the Lord of Life. In the moon
lives Old-Woman-Who-Never-Dies. She has six
children, three sons and three daughters. These
live in the sky. The eldest son is the Day; another is
the Sun; another is Night. The eldest daughter is the
Morning Star, called &ldquo;The Woman who Wears a
Plume&rdquo;; another is a star which circles around the
polar star, and she is called &ldquo;The Striped Gourd&rdquo;; the
third is Evening Star.</p>

<p>Every spring Old-Woman-Who-Never-Dies sends
the wild geese, the swans, and the ducks. When
she sends the wild geese, the Indians plant their corn
and Old-Woman-Who-Never-Dies makes it grow.
When eleven wild geese are found together, the Indians
know the corn crop will be very large. The swans
mean that the Indians must plant gourds; the ducks,
that they must plant beans.</p>

<p>Indians always save dried meat for these wild birds,
so when they come in the spring they may have a corn
feast. They build scaffolds of many poles, three or
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg&nbsp;99]</a></span>
four rows, and one above the others. On this they hang
the meat. Then the old women in the village, each one
with a stick, meet around the scaffold. In one end of
the stick is an ear of corn. Sitting in a circle, they
plant their sticks in the ground in front of them. Then
they dance around the scaffolds while the old men beat
the drums and rattle the gourds.</p>

<p>Afterwards the old women in the village are allowed
to eat the dried meat.</p>

<p>In the fall they hold another corn feast, after the
corn is ripe. This is so that Old-Woman-Who-Never-Dies
may send the buffalo herds to them. Each
woman carries the entire cornstalk, with the ears attached,
just as it was pulled up by the roots. Then
they call on Old-Woman-Who-Never-Dies and say,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mother, pity us. Do not send the cold too soon,
or we may not have enough meat. Mother, do not let
the game depart, so that we may have enough for
winter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the fall, when the birds go south to Old-Woman,
they take back the dried meat hung on the scaffolds,
because Old-Woman is very fond of it.</p>

<p>Old-Woman-Who-Never-Dies has large patches of
corn, kept for her by the great stag and by the white-tailed
stag. Blackbirds also help her guard her corn
patches. The corn patches are large, therefore the Old
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg&nbsp;100]</a></span>
Woman has the help also of the mice and the moles.
In the spring the birds go north, back to Old-Man-Who-Never-Dies.</p>

<p>In the olden time, Old-Woman-Who-Never-Dies
lived near the Little Missouri. Sometimes the Indians
visited her. One day twelve came, and she offered
them only a small kettle of corn. They were very
hungry and the kettle was very small. But as soon as
it was empty, it at once became filled again, so all the
Indians had enough to eat.</p>

<h2>LEGEND OF THE CORN</h2>

<p class="subtitle">Arikara</p>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>he Arikara were the first to find the maize.
A young man went out hunting. He came to
a high hill. Looking down a valley, he saw a
buffalo bull near where two rivers joined. When the
young man looked to see how he could kill the buffalo,
he saw how beautiful the country was. The banks of
the two rivers were low, with many trees. The buffalo
faced the north; therefore he could not get within bowshot
of him. He thought he should wait until the buffalo
moved close to the banks of one of the rivers, or to
a ravine where there were bushes and shrubs. So the
young man waited. The sun went down before the buffalo
moved.</p>

<p>Nearly all night the hunter lay awake. He had little
food. He felt sorry he could not reach the buffalo.
Before the sun rose, he hurried to the top of the hill.
The buffalo stood just where it had, but it faced the
east. Again he waited for it to move. He waited all
day. When the sun went down, the buffalo still stood
in the same place.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg&nbsp;102]</a></span>
Nearly all night the young man lay awake. He had
very little food indeed. The next morning he rose
early, and came to the top of the hill, just as the sun
came up. The buffalo was still standing in the same
place; but now it faced the south. He waited all day.
Then the sun went down.</p>

<p>Now the next morning, when he arose early, the
buffalo stood in the same place; this time it faced the
west. All day the young man waited, but the buffalo
did not move.</p>

<p>Now the young man thought, &ldquo;Why does not the
buffalo move?&rdquo; He saw it did not drink, did not eat,
did not sleep. He thought some power must be influencing
it.</p>

<p>Now the next morning, the young man hurried to
the top of the hill. The sun had risen and everything
was light. The buffalo was gone. Then he saw where
the buffalo had stood there was a strange bush.</p>

<p>He went to the place; then he saw it was a plant. He
looked for the tracks of the buffalo. He saw where it
had turned to the east and to the south and to the west.
In the center there was one track; out of it the small
plant had grown. There was no track to show where
the buffalo had left the place.</p>

<p>Then the hunter hurried to his village. He told
the chiefs and the people of the strange buffalo and the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg&nbsp;103]</a></span>
plant. So all the chiefs and the people came to the
place. They saw the tracks of the buffalo as he had
stood, but there were no tracks of his coming or going.</p>

<p>So all the people knew that Wahkoda had given this
strange plant to the people. They knew of other plants
they might eat. They knew there was a time when each
plant was ripe. So they watched the strange plant;
they guarded it and protected it.</p>

<p>Then a flower appeared on the plant. Afterwards,
at one of the joints, a new part of the plant pushed out.
It had hair. At first the hair was green; then it was
brown. Then the people thought, &ldquo;Perhaps this fruit
is ripe.&rdquo; But they did not dare touch it. They met
together. They looked at the plant.</p>

<p>Then a young man said, &ldquo;My life has not been good.
If any evil comes to me, it will not matter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the people were willing, and the young man put
his hand on the plant and then on its fruit. He grasped
the fruit boldly. He said to the people, &ldquo;It is solid. It
is ripe.&rdquo; Then he pulled apart the husks, and said, &ldquo;It
is red.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He took a few of the grains and showed them to the
people. He ate some. He did not die. So the people
knew Wahkoda had sent this plant to them for food.</p>

<p>Now in the fall, when the prairie grass turned brown,
the leaves of this plant turned brown also. Then the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg&nbsp;104]</a></span>
fruit was plucked, and put away. After the winter was
over, the kernels were divided. There were four to
each family.</p>

<p>Then the people moved the lodges to the place where
the plant had grown. When the hills became green,
they planted the seed of the strange plant. But first
they built little mounds like the one out of which it
grew. So the fruit grew and ripened. It had many
colors; red, and yellow, and white, and blue.</p>

<p>Then the next year there were many plants and many
ears of corn. So they sent to other tribes. They invited
them to visit them and gave them of the new
food. Thus the Omahas came to have corn.</p>

<h2>TRADITION OF THE FINDING OF HORSES</h2>

<p class="subtitle">Ponca</p>


<p><span class="dropcap">L</span>ong ago, the people followed the Missouri
River northward to a place where they could
step over the water. Then they turned, and
were going across the land. Then they met the
Padouca [Comanche].</p>

<p>At that time the Ponca had no animals but dogs to
help them carry burdens. Wherever they went they
had to go on foot, but the people were strong and fleet.
They could run a great distance and not be weary. One
day when they were hunting buffalo, they met the
Padouca. Then they had many battles with them.
The Padouca were mounted on strange animals. At
first the Ponca thought it was all one animal. The
Padouca had bows made from elk horn. They were
not very long, nor were they very strong. They boiled
the horn until it was soft; then they scraped it, and
bound it together with sinews and glue. Their arrows
were tipped with bone. They fought also with a stone
battle-ax. The handle was a sapling; a grooved stone
ax head, pointed at both ends, was fastened to this with
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg&nbsp;106]</a></span>
rawhides. So the Padouca were terrible fighters.
They protected their horses with a covering of thick
rawhide cut in round pieces, and put together like
fish scales. They spread glue over the outside and then
sand. So when the Comanches fought, the arrows of
their enemies glanced off the horses&rsquo; armor. Then the
Padouca made breastplates for themselves like those of
the horses.</p>

<p>When the Ponca met these terrible warriors, they
were afraid. They thought man and horse were one.
They named it &ldquo;Kawa&rdquo; because they noticed the odor
of the horse. Then they knew by this odor when the
Padouca were coming. When a man smelled the
horses, he would run to the camp and say, &ldquo;The wind
tells us the Kawa are coming.&rdquo; Then the Ponca would
make ready to defend themselves. The Ponca had
many battles with the Comanches. They did not know
how to use the animals, so they killed the horses as well
as the men. Neither could they find out where the
Padouca lived.</p>

<p>One day the two tribes had a great battle. The
people fought all day. Sometimes the Ponca were
driven back, sometimes the Padouca. Then at last a
Ponca shot a Padouca so that he fell from his horse.
Then the battle ceased. After this, one of the Padouca
came toward the Ponca and said in plain Ponca,</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg&nbsp;107]</a></span>
&ldquo;Who are you? What do you call yourselves?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Ponca replied, &ldquo;We call ourselves Ponca. You
speak our language, are you of our tribe?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The other said, &ldquo;No. I speak your language as a
gift from a Ponca spirit. One day I lay on a Ponca
grave after a battle. Then a man rose from the grave
and spoke to me. So I know your language.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then it was agreed to make peace. The tribes
visited each other. The Ponca traded their bows and
arrows for horses. They knew where the Padouca
lived. Then the Padouca taught the Ponca how to
ride, and how to put burdens on the horses.</p>

<p>When the Ponca had learned how to ride, and had
horses, they went to war again. They attacked the
Padouca in their own village. They attacked them so
many times and stole so many of their horses that at last
the Padouca fled. We do not know where they went.
The Ponca followed the Platte River toward the rising
sun; then they came back to the Missouri, and they
brought their horses with them.</p>

<h2>DAKOTA BELIEFS AND CUSTOMS</h2>

<p class="subtitle">Dakota</p>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>he Dakotas have names for the natural divisions
of time. Their years they count by winters.
A man is so many winters old, or so many
winters have passed since such an event. When one
goes on a journey, he says he will be back in so many
sleeps. They have no division of time into weeks, and
their months are literally by moons.</p>

<p>The Dakotas believe that when the moon is full,
a great number of small mice begin to nibble on one
side. They nibble until they eat up the entire moon.
So when the new moon begins to grow, it is to them
really a new moon; the old one has been eaten up.</p>

<p>The Dakota mother loves her baby as well as the
white woman does hers. When the spirit takes its flight
a wild howl goes up from the tent. The baby form
is wrapped in the best buffalo calfskin, or the best red
blanket, and laid away on a scaffold or on the branch
of some tree. There the mother goes with disheveled
hair and oldest clothes, the best ones having been given
away, and wails out her sorrow in the twilight, wailing
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg&nbsp;109]</a></span>
often until far into the cold night. The nice kettle of
hominy is prepared, and carried to the scaffold where
the spirit hovers for several days. When the kettle has
remained there long enough for the <i>wanagi</i>, the spirit,
to inhale the food, the little children of the village are
invited to eat up the rest.</p>

<p>When a hunter dies, the last act of the medicine man
is to sing a song to conduct the spirit over the <i>wanagi
tacanku</i>, the spirit&rsquo;s road, as the Milky Way is called.
The friends give away their good clothes. They wear
ragged clothes, with bare feet, and ashes on their hands.
Both within and without the lodge there is a great wailing.
&ldquo;<i>Micinski, micinski, my son, my son,</i>&rdquo; is the
lamentation in Dakota land as it was in Israel.</p>

<p>The dead hunter is wrapped in the most beautifully
painted buffalo robe, or in the newest red and blue
blanket. Young men are called and feasted, and their
duty it is to carry the body away and place it on a scaffold,
for the dead remain not long in the tepee. In
more recent times they bury it. The custom of burial
immediately after death, however, was not a Dakota
custom. The spirit did not bid farewell to the body
for several days after death, and so the body was laid
on a high scaffold or in some tree crotch where it would
have a good view of the surrounding country, and also
be safe from wolves.</p>

<h2>WHY THE TETONS BURY ON SCAFFOLDS</h2>

<p class="subtitle">Teton</p>


<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>n the olden days, the people buried some men on a
hill. Then they removed their camp to another
place. Many winters afterwards, a man visited
the hill; but there were no graves there. So he told
the people.</p>

<p>Then many men came and dug far down into the
hill. By and by a man said, &ldquo;There is a road here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There they found a road, a tunnel, large enough for
men to walk, stooping. Other roads there were. They
followed the first road and they came to a place where
a strange animal had dragged the bodies of those who
were buried in the hill.</p>

<p>Therefore the people refused to bury their dead in
the ground. They bury them on scaffolds where the
animals cannot reach them.<a name="FNanchor_M_13" id="FNanchor_M_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_M_13" class="fnanchor">[M]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_M_13" id="Footnote_M_13"></a><a href="#FNanchor_M_13"><span class="label">[M]</span></a> At the present day, the Teton gives three reasons for not burying
in the ground: animals or persons might walk over the graves; the
dead might lie in mud and water after rain or snow; wolves might
trouble the bodies.</p></div>

<h2>THE GHOST&rsquo;S RESENTMENT</h2>

<p class="subtitle">Dakota</p>


<p><span class="dropcap">L</span>ong, long ago, a Dakota died and his parents
made a death lodge for him on the bluff. In
the lodge they made a grave scaffold, on which
they laid the body of their son.</p>

<p>Now in that same village of Dakotas lived a young
married man. His father lived with him, and there
were two old men who used to visit the father and
smoke with him, and talk with him about many things.</p>

<p>One night the father of the young man said, &ldquo;My
friends, let us go to the death scaffold and cut off summer
robes for ourselves from the tent skins.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The young man said, &ldquo;No! Do not do so. It was
a pity the young man died, and as his parents had nothing
else to give up for him they made the death lodge
and left it there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What use can he get from the tent?&rdquo; asked the
father. &ldquo;We have no robes, so we wish to use part of
the tent skins for ourselves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; said the young man. &ldquo;Go as you
have said and we shall see what will happen.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg&nbsp;112]</a></span>
The old men arose without saying a word and went
to the lodge on the bluff. As soon as they were gone,
the young man said, &ldquo;Oh, wife, get my piece of white
clay. I must scare one of those old men nearly to
death.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the woman was unwilling, saying, &ldquo;Let them
alone. They have no robes. Let them cut off robes for
themselves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But as the husband would not stop talking about it,
the wife got the piece of white clay for him. He
whitened his whole body and his face and hands. Then
he went to the lodge in a course parallel to that taken
by the old men. He went very quickly and reached
there before they did.</p>

<p>He climbed the scaffold and lay on it, thrusting his
head out through the tent skins just above the doorway.</p>

<p>At last the old men approached, ascending the hill,
and talking together in a low tone. The young man
lay still, listening to them. When they reached the
lodge, they sat down.</p>

<p>The leader said, &ldquo;Fill your pipe, friends. We must
smoke this last time with our friend up there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, your friend has spoken well. That should be
done,&rdquo; answered one of them.</p>

<p>So he filled the pipe. He drew a whiff, and when
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg&nbsp;113]</a></span>
the fire glowed, he turned the pipestem toward the
seam of the skins above the doorway. He looked up
towards the sky, saying, &ldquo;Ho, friend, here is the pipe.
We must smoke with you this last time. And then we
must separate. Here is the pipe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As he said this, he gazed above the doorway and saw
a head looking out from the tent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! My friends!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Look at this place
behind you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When the two looked, they said, &ldquo;Really! Friends,
it is he!&rdquo; And all fled.</p>

<p>Then the young man leaped down and pursued them.
Two of them fell to the ground in terror, but he did
not disturb them, going on in pursuit of his father.
When the old man was overtaken, he fell to the ground.
He was terrified. The young man sat astride of him.
He said, &ldquo;You have been very disobedient! Fill the
pipe for me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The old man said, &ldquo;Oh! My grandchild! Oh! My
grandchild!&rdquo; hoping that the ghost would pity him.
Then he filled the pipe as he lay stretched there and
gave it to his son.</p>

<p>The young man smoked. When he stopped smoking,
the old man said, &ldquo;Oh! My grandchild! Oh!
My grandchild! Pity me, and let me go. We thought
we must smoke with you this last time, so we went
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg&nbsp;114]</a></span>
to the place where you were. Oh! My grandchild,
pity me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If that be so, arise and extend your hands to me
in entreaty,&rdquo; said the young man.</p>

<p>The old man arose and did so, saying continually,
&ldquo;Oh! My grandchild! Oh! My grandchild!&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was as much as the young man could do to keep
from laughing. At length he said, &ldquo;Well! Begone!
Beware lest you come again and go around my resting
place very often! Do not visit it again!&rdquo; Then he let
the old man go.</p>

<p>On returning to the burial lodge, he found the two
old men still lying where they had fallen. When he
approached them, they slipped off, with their heads
covered, as they were terrified, and he let them go
undisturbed. When they had gone, the young man hurried
home. He reached there first and after washing
himself, reclined at full length.</p>

<p>He said to his wife, &ldquo;When they return, be sure not
to laugh. Make an effort to control yourself. I came
very near making them die of fright.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When the old men returned, the young people seemed
to be asleep. The old men did not lie down; all sat
in silence, smoking together until daylight. When the
young man arose in the morning, the old men appeared
very sorrowful.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg&nbsp;115]</a></span>
Then he said, &ldquo;Give me one of the robes that you
and your friends cut off and brought back. I, too, have
no robe at all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His father said, &ldquo;Why! We went there, but we did
not get anything at all. We were attacked. We came
very near being killed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To this the son replied, &ldquo;Why! I was unwilling
for this to happen, so I said, &lsquo;Do not go,&rsquo; but you paid
no attention to me, and went. But now you think
differently and you weep.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When it was night, the young man said, &ldquo;Go again
and make another attempt. Bring back a piece for me,
as I have no robe at all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The old men were unwilling to go again, and they
lost their patience, as he teased them so often.</p>

<h2>THE FORKED ROADS</h2>

<p class="subtitle">Omaha</p>


<p><span class="dropcap">L</span>ong ago, in the days of the grandfathers, a man
died and was buried by his village. For four
nights his ghost had to walk a very dark trail.
Then he reached the Milky Way and there was plenty
of light. For this reason, people ought to keep the
funeral fires lighted for four nights, so the spirit will
not walk in the dark trail.</p>

<p>The spirit walked along the Milky Way. At last
he came to a point where the trail forked. There sat
an old man. He was dressed in a buffalo robe, with
the hair on the outside. He pointed to each ghost the
road he was to take. One was short and led to the land
of good ghosts. The other was very long; along it the
ghosts went wailing.</p>

<p>The spirits of suicides cannot travel either road.
They must hover over their graves. For them there is
no future life.</p>

<p>A murderer is never happy after he dies. Ghosts
surround him and keep up a constant whistling. He is
always hungry, though he eat much food. He is never
allowed to go where he pleases, lest high winds arise
and sweep down upon the others.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg&nbsp;117]</a></span></p>
<h2>TATTOOED GHOSTS</h2>

<p class="subtitle">Dakota</p>


<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>f a ghost wishes to walk the Ghost Road safely,
then during living the person must tattoo himself
either in the forehead or on the wrists. An old
woman sits in the Ghost Road and she examines each
ghost who passes. If she finds the tattoo marks, then
the ghost travels on at once to Many Lodges. If the
tattoo marks are not there, the old woman pushes the
ghost from a cloud and he falls to this world again.
Then he wanders all over the world. He is never quiet.
He goes about whistling, with no lodge, and people are
afraid of him.</p>

<p>When these ghosts visit the sick, they are driven
away by smoke from the sacred cedar, or else cedar is
laid outside the lodge. When a person hears a ghost
whistling he goes outside the lodge and makes a loud
noise. If a ghost calls to a loved one and he answers,
then he is sure to die soon.</p>

<p>If a ghost meets a man who is alone, he will catch
hold of him and pull his mouth and eyes until they are
crooked. Indeed, a ghost did this to a person who only
dreamed about one.</p>

They were Ponca. As they approached the foe,
they camped for the night. They kindled a
fire. It was during the night. After kindling a bright
fire, they sat down; they made the fire burn very
brightly. Rejoicing greatly, they sat eating. Very suddenly
a person sang.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Keep quiet. Push the ashes over that fire. Seize
your bow in silence!&rdquo; said their leader. All took their
bows. And they departed to surround him. They
made the circle smaller and smaller, and commenced
at once to come together. And still he stood singing;
he did not stir at all. At length they went very near to
the tree. And when they drew very near to it, the
singer ceased his song. When they had reached the
tree, bones lay there in a pile. Human bones were
piled there at the foot of the tree. When persons die,
the Dakotas usually suspend the bodies in trees.</p>

<h2>THE GHOST AND THE TRAVELER</h2>

<p class="subtitle">Teton</p>


<p><span class="dropcap">O</span>nce an Indian alone was just at the edge of
a forest. Then the Thunder Beings raised a
great storm. So he remained there for the
night. After it was dark, he noticed a light in the
woods. When he reached the spot, behold! there was
a sweat lodge, in which were two persons talking.</p>

<p>One said, &ldquo;Friend, someone has come and stands
without. Let us invite him to share our food.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then the Indian fled because they were ghosts. But
they followed him. He looked back now and then,
but he could not see them.</p>

<p>All at once he heard the cry of a woman. He was
glad to have company. But the moment he thought
about the woman, she appeared. She said, &ldquo;I have
come because you have just wished to have company.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This frightened the man. The woman said, &ldquo;Do not
fear me; else you will never see me again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They journeyed until daybreak. The man looked at
her. She seemed to have no legs, yet she walked without
any effort. Then the man thought, &ldquo;What if she
should choke me.&rdquo; Immediately the ghost vanished.</p>

<h2>THE MAN WHO SHOT A GHOST</h2>

<p class="subtitle">Teton</p>


<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>n the olden time, a man was traveling alone, and
in a forest he killed several rabbits. After sunset
he was in the midst of the forest. He had to spend
the night there, so he made a fire.</p>

<p>He thought this: &ldquo;Should I meet any danger by
and by, I will shoot. I am a man who ought not to
regard anything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He cooked a rabbit, so he was no longer hungry.
Just then he heard many voices. They were talking
about their own affairs. But the man could see no one.</p>

<p>So he thought: &ldquo;It seems now that at last I have
encountered ghosts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then he went and lay under a fallen tree, which was
a great distance from the fire. They came around him
and whistled, &ldquo;<i>Hyu! hyu! hyu!</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He has gone yonder,&rdquo; said one of the ghosts. Then
they came and stood around the man, just as people do
when they hunt rabbits. The man lay flat beneath the
fallen tree, and one ghost came and climbed on the
trunk of that tree. Suddenly the ghost gave the cry
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg&nbsp;121]</a></span>
that a man does when he hits an enemy, &ldquo;<i>A-he!</i>&rdquo; Then
the ghost kicked the man in the back.</p>

<p>Before the ghost could get away, very suddenly the
man shot at him and wounded him in the legs. So the
ghost cried as men do in pain, &ldquo;<i>Au! au! au!</i>&rdquo; At last
he went off, crying as women do, &ldquo;<i>Yun! yun! yun!
yun!</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>The other ghosts said to him, &ldquo;Where did he shoot?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The wounded ghost said, &ldquo;He shot me through the
head and I have come apart.&rdquo; Then the other ghosts
were wailing on the hillside.</p>

<p>The man decided he would go to the place where
the ghosts were wailing. So when day came, he went
there. He found some graves. Into one of them a wolf
had dug, so that the bones could be seen; and there
was a wound in the skull.</p>

<h2>THE INDIAN WHO WRESTLED WITH A GHOST</h2>

<p class="subtitle">Teton</p>


<p><span class="dropcap">A</span> young man went alone on the warpath. At
length he reached a wood. One day, as he was
going along, he heard a voice. He said, &ldquo;I
shall have company.&rdquo; As he was approaching a forest,
he heard some one halloo. Behold, it was an owl.</p>

<p>By and by he drew near another wood, and as night
was coming on he lay down to rest. At the edge of the
trees he lay down in the open air. At midnight he
was aroused by the voice of a woman. She was wailing,
&ldquo;My son! my son!&rdquo; Still he remained where he was,
and put more wood on the fire. He lay with his back
to the fire. He tore a hole in his blanket large enough
to peep through.</p>

<p>Soon he heard twigs break under the feet of one
approaching, so he looked through his blanket without
rising. Behold, a woman of the olden days was
coming. She wore a skin dress with long fringe. A
buffalo robe was fastened around her at the waist.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg&nbsp;123]</a></span>
Her necklace was of very large beads, and her leggings
were covered with beads or porcupine work. Her
robe was drawn over her head and she was snuffing as
she came.</p>

<p>The man lay with his legs stretched out, and she
stood by him. She took him by one foot, which she
raised very slowly. When she let it go, it fell with a
thud as though he were dead. She raised it a second
time; then a third time. Still the man did not move.
Then the woman pulled a very rusty knife from the
front of her belt, seized his foot suddenly and was about
to lift it and cut it, when up sprang the man. He said,
&ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo; Then he shot at her suddenly.
She ran into the forest screaming, &ldquo;<i>Yun! yun!
yun! yun! yun! yun!</i>&rdquo; She plunged into the forest and
was seen no more.</p>

<p>Again the man covered his head with his blanket but
he did not sleep. When day came, he raised his eyes.
Behold, there was a burial scaffold, with the blankets
all ragged and dangling. He thought, &ldquo;Was this the
ghost that came to me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Again he came to a wood where he had to remain
for the night. He started a fire. As he sat there, suddenly
he heard someone singing. He made the woods
ring. The man shouted to the singer, but no answer
was paid. The man had a small quantity of <i>wasna</i>,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg&nbsp;124]</a></span>
which was grease mixed with pounded buffalo meat,
and wild cherry; he also had plenty of tobacco.</p>

<p>So when the singer came and asked him for food,
the man said, &ldquo;I have nothing.&rdquo; The ghost said,
&ldquo;Not so; I know you have some <i>wasna</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then the man gave some of it to the ghost and filled
his pipe. After the meal, when the stranger took the
pipe and held it by the stem, the traveler saw that it
was nothing but bones. There was no flesh. Then
the stranger&rsquo;s robe dropped back from his shoulders.
Behold, all his ribs were visible. There was no flesh on
them. The ghost did not open his lips when he smoked.
The smoke came pouring out through his ribs.</p>

<p>When he had finished smoking, the ghost said, &ldquo;Ho!
we must wrestle together. If you can throw me, you
shall kill the enemy without hindrance and steal some
horses.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The young man agreed. But first he threw an armful
of brush on the fire. He put plenty of brush near
the fire.</p>

<p>Then the ghost rushed at the man. He seized him
with his bony hands, which was very painful; but this
mattered not. The man tried to push off the ghost,
whose legs were very powerful. When the ghost was
pulled near the fire, he became weak; but when he
pulled the young man toward the darkness, he became
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg&nbsp;125]</a></span>
strong. As the fire got low, the strength of the ghost
increased. Just as the man began to get weary, the
day broke. Then the struggle began again. As they
drew near the fire again, the man made a last effort;
with his foot he pushed more brush into the fire. The
fire blazed up again suddenly. Then the ghost fell, just
as if he was coming to pieces.</p>

<p>So the man won in wrestling. Also he killed his
enemy and stole some horses. It came out just as the
ghost said. That is why people believe what ghosts
say.</p>

<h2>THE WAKANDA, OR WATER GOD</h2>

<p class="subtitle">Yankton</p>


<p><span class="dropcap">A</span> man and his wife had only one child, they say,
whom they loved very much. He used to go
playing every day, they say; and one day he
fell into the water. His father and mother and all his
relations wailed regularly. His father was very sad,
they say. He would not sleep within the lodge; he lay
out of doors, without any pillow at all. When he lay
on the ground with his cheek on the palm of his hand,
he heard his child crying. He heard him crying down
under the ground, they say. Having assembled all his
relations, he spoke of digging into the ground. The
relations collected horses to be given as pay; they collected
goods and horses. Then came two old men who
said they were sacred. They spoke of seeking for the
child. An old man went to tell the father. He brought
the two sacred men to the lodge. The father filled a
pipe with tobacco. He gave it to the sacred men, and
said, &ldquo;If you bring my child back, I will give all this
to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So they painted themselves; one made his body very
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg&nbsp;127]</a></span>
black, the other made his body very yellow. Both went
into the deep water. So they arrived there, they say.
They talked to the wakanda. The child was not dead;
he was sitting up, alive.</p>

<p>The men said, &ldquo;The father demands his child. We
have him; we will go homeward,&rdquo; they said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have him; but if you take him homeward
with you, he shall die. Had you taken him before he
ate anything, he might have lived. Begone ye, and tell
those words to his father.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The two men went. They arrived at the lodge, they
say.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have seen your child; the wakanda&rsquo;s wife has
him. We saw him alive, but he has eaten of the food
of the wakandas. Therefore the wakanda says that if
we bring the child back with us out of the water, he
shall die.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Still, the father wished to see him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If the wakanda&rsquo;s wife gives you back your child,
she desires a very white dog as pay.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I promise to give her the white dog,&rdquo; said the
father.</p>

<p>Again the two men painted themselves; the one made
himself very black, the other made himself very yellow.
Again they went beneath the water. They
arrived at the place again.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg&nbsp;128]</a></span>
&ldquo;The father said we were to take the child back at
any cost; he spoke of seeing his child.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the wakanda gave the child back to them; homeward
they went with him. When they reached the
surface of the water with him, the child died. They
gave him back to his father. Then all the people
wailed when they saw the child, their relation.</p>

<p>They plunged the white-haired dog into the water.
When they had buried the child they gave pay to the
two men.</p>

<p>After a while, the parents lost another child, a girl,
in the same way, they say. But she did not eat any of
the wakanda&rsquo;s food, therefore they took her home alive.
But it was another wakanda who took her, and he
promised to give her back if they would give him four
white-haired dogs.</p>

<h2>THE SPIRIT LAND</h2>

<p class="subtitle">Arapahoe</p>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>he spirit world is toward the Darkening Land,
higher up, and separated from the world of
living by a great lake. Now when the spirits
came back to this world [in the ghost-dance excitement]
Crow was their leader. That is because Crow is black;
his color is the same as that of the Darkening Land.
Crow was followed by all the Indians. But when they
reached the edge of the shadow land, below them was
a great sea.</p>

<p>Far away, toward the Sunrise Land were their
people in the world of living. So Crow took a pebble
in his beak. He dropped it into the water, and it
became a mountain, towering up to the shadow land.
So the Indians came down the mountain side to the
edge of the water.</p>

<p>Then Crow took some dust in his bill. He flew out
and dropped it into the water, and it became solid
land. It stretched between the spirit land and the
world of living.</p>

<p>Then Crow flew out again, with blades of grass in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg&nbsp;130]</a></span>
his beak. He dropped these upon the new made land.
At once the earth was covered with green grass.</p>

<p>Again Crow flew out with twigs in his beak, and he
dropped these upon the new earth. At once it was
covered with a forest of trees.</p>

<p>Again he flew back to the base of the mountain.
Then he called all the spirit Indians together. Now
he is coming to help the living Indians. He has already
passed the sea. He is now on the western edge of the
world of living.</p>

<h2>WAZIYA, THE WEATHER SPIRIT</h2>

<p class="subtitle">Teton</p>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>he giant called Waziya knows when there is
to be a change of weather. He is a giant.
When he travels, his footprints are large
enough for several Indians to stand in abreast. His
strides are very far apart; at one step he can go over a
hill.</p>

<p>When it is cold, people say, &ldquo;Waziya has returned.&rdquo;
They used to pray to him, but when they found he paid
no attention to him, they ceased to do it.</p>

<p>When warm weather is coming, Waziya wraps himself
in a thick robe. But when cold weather is coming,
he wears nothing at all. Waziya, the giant god of the
north, and Itokaga, the god of the south, are ever battling.
Each in turn wins the victory.</p>

<p>They say, &ldquo;Oh, grandfather, I wish good weather.

<p>Then the youngest son of one of the Wind People,
but one half grown, is selected. He is painted all over
with red paint. Then he goes out into the storm and
rolls over and over the snow, reddening it for some distance.
This stops the storm.</p>

<h2>IKTO AND THE SNOWSTORM</h2>

<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>kto was the first person in this world. He is more
cunning than human beings. He it was who
named all the animals and people. But sometimes
Ikto was tricked by the beings he had created.</p>

<p>One day Ikto was hungry; just then he caught a rabbit.
He was about to roast him.</p>

<p>Suddenly Rabbit said, &ldquo;Oh, Ikto, I will teach you
a magic art.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ikto said, &ldquo;I have created all things.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I will show you something new,&rdquo; said Rabbit.
Therefore Ikto consented. He let go of Rabbit.</p>

<p>Rabbit stood in front of Ikto and said, &ldquo;Elder
brother, if you wish snow to fall at any time, take some
hair such as this,&rdquo;&mdash;and he pulled out some of his
rabbit fur&mdash;&ldquo;and blow it in all directions; there will
be a blizzard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rabbit made a deep snow in this way, though the
leaves were green.</p>

<p>At once, Ikto began to pull his own fur and say
magic words. Rabbit made a long leap and ran away.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg&nbsp;134]</a></span>
Ikto pulled his fur and blew it about. But there was
no snow. Then he pulled more fur, and blew it about.
Still there was no snow. It was only rabbit fur that
made the snow.</p>

So South let his daughter marry him. Then North

All the people there lived in ice houses.</p>

<p>The next day, after sunrise, the houses began to

warmer. Then North&rsquo;s people came to him. They

<h2>THE FALLEN STAR</h2>

<p class="subtitle">Dakota</p>


<p><span class="dropcap">A</span> people had this camp. And there were two
women sleeping out of doors and looking up
at the stars.</p>

<p>One of them said, &ldquo;I wish that that large and bright
shining star were my husband.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The other said, &ldquo;I wish the star that shines less
brightly were my husband.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And immediately both were immediately carried
upward, they say. They found themselves in a beautiful
country which was full of beautiful twin flowers.
And they found that the star which had shone most
brightly was a large man; the other star was only a
young man. So the two stars married the two women
and they lived in that beautiful Star Country.</p>

<p>Now in that country was a plant, the Teepsinna, with
large, attractive stalks. The wife of the large star
wanted to dig them. Her husband said, &ldquo;No; no one
does so here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then the camp moved. When the woman had
pitched her tepee, and came inside to lay the mats, she
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg&nbsp;137]</a></span>
saw there a beautiful teepsinna. She said to herself,
&ldquo;I will dig this; no one will see me.&rdquo; So she took
her digging stick and dug the teepsinna; but when she
pulled it out of the earth, the foundation of the Star
Country broke and she fell through with her baby.
So the woman died; but the baby was not injured. It
lay there stretched out.</p>

<p>An old man came that way. When he saw that the
baby was alive, he took it in his blanket and took it to
his own lodge. He said to his wife, &ldquo;Old woman, I
saw something today that made my heart feel badly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What was it?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A woman lay dead; and a little baby boy lay beside
her kicking.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why did you not bring it home, old man?&rdquo; she
asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here it is,&rdquo; he said. Then he took it out of his
blanket.</p>

<p>The wife said, &ldquo;Old man, let us adopt this child.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The old man said, &ldquo;We will swing it around the
tepee.&rdquo; He whirled it up through the smoke hole. It
went whirling around and around and fell down, and
came creeping into the tent.</p>

<p>Again he took up the baby and threw it up through
the smoke hole. It got up and came into the tent walking.
Again the old man whirled him out. In came a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg&nbsp;138]</a></span>
boy with some green sticks. He said, &ldquo;Grandfather, I
wish you would make me arrows.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Again the old man whirled him out. No one knows
where he went. This time he came back into the tepee
a long man, with many green sticks. He said, &ldquo;Grandfather,
make me arrows of these.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the old man made him arrows, and he killed a
great many buffaloes, and they made a large tepee, and
built up a high sleeping place in the back part of the
tepee, and were very rich in dried meat.</p>

<p>The old man said, &ldquo;Old woman, I am glad we are
well off; I will proclaim it abroad.&rdquo; So when morning
came, he went to the top of the tent, and sat, and said,
&ldquo;I, I have abundance laid up. I eat the fat of the
animals.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That is how the meadow lark came to be made, they
say. It has a yellow breast and black in the middle,
which is the yellow of that morning, and they say the
black stripe is made by a smooth buffalo horn worn for
a necklace.</p>

<p>The young man said, &ldquo;Grandfather, I want to go
visiting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the old man. &ldquo;When one is young is
the time to go visiting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The young man went and came to a people, and lo!
they were engaged in shooting arrows through a hoop.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg&nbsp;139]</a></span>
And there was a young man who was simply looking
on. By and by he said, &ldquo;My friend, let us go to your
house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So they came to his lodge. Now this young man also
had been raised by his grandmother, and lived with her,
they say.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Grandmother, I have brought my friend home with
me; get him something to eat,&rdquo; said the grandson.</p>

<p>Grandmother said, &ldquo;What shall I do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then the visiting young man said, &ldquo;How is it, grandmother?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She said, &ldquo;The people are about to die of thirst. All
who go for water will not come back again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fallen Star said, &ldquo;My friend, take a kettle; we will
go for water.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;With difficulty have I raised my grandchild,&rdquo;
objected the old woman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are afraid of trifles,&rdquo; said the grandson. So he
went with Star-born.</p>

<p>They reached the side of the lake. By the water of
the lake stood troughs half full of water.</p>

<p>Star-born called out, &ldquo;You who they say have killed
every one who has come for water, where have you
gone? I have come for water.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then immediately whither they went is not manifest.
Behold, there was a long house which was extended,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg&nbsp;140]</a></span>
and it was full of young men and women. Some of
them were dead and some were dying.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How did you come here?&rdquo; asked Star-born.</p>

<p>They replied, &ldquo;What do you mean? We came for
water and something swallowed us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Something kept striking on the head of Star-born.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is this?&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Get away,&rdquo; they replied, &ldquo;that is the heart.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then he drew out his knife and cut it to pieces. Suddenly
something made a great noise. In the great body,
these people were swallowed up. When the heart died,
death came to the body. Then Star-born cut a great
hole in the side, and came out, bringing the young men
and the young women. All came to life again.</p>

<p>So the people were thankful and offered him two
wives.</p>

<p>But he said, &ldquo;I am journeying. My friend here will
marry them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Star-born went on, they say. Again he found
a young man standing where they were shooting
through a hoop. He said, &ldquo;I will look on with my
friend,&rdquo; and went and stood beside him.</p>

<p>Then the other said, &ldquo;My friend, let us go home,&rdquo;
so he went with him to his tepee.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Grandmother, I have brought my friend home with
me,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Get him something to eat.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg&nbsp;141]</a></span>
Grandmother replied, &ldquo;How shall I do as you
say?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How is it?&rdquo; said Star-born.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This people are perishing for wood,&rdquo; she said;
&ldquo;when any one goes for wood, he never comes home
again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Star-born said, &ldquo;My friend, take the packing strap;
we will go for wood.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The old woman protested. &ldquo;This one, my grandchild,
I have raised with difficulty,&rdquo; she said. He
answered, &ldquo;Old woman, what you are afraid of are
trifles,&rdquo; and went with the young man. &ldquo;I am going
to bring wood,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;If any wish to go, come
along.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The young man who came from somewhere says
this,&rdquo; they said, so they followed him.</p>

<p>They had now reached the wood. They found it
tied up in bundles. He ordered them to carry it home,
but he stood still and said, &ldquo;You who killed every
one who came to this wood, where have you gone?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then, suddenly, where he went was not made manifest.
And lo! a tepee, and in it some young men and
young women; some were eating, and some were
waiting.</p>

<p>He said to them, &ldquo;How came you here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>They answered, &ldquo;What do you mean? We came for
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg&nbsp;142]</a></span>
wood and something brought us here. Now you also
are lost.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He looked behind him, and lo! there was a hole.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is this?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; they said. &ldquo;That is the thing itself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He drew out an arrow and shot it. Then suddenly
it opened out and behold! it was the ear of an owl in
which they had been shut up. When it was killed, it
opened out. Then he said, &ldquo;Young men and women,
come out,&rdquo; so they went home.</p>

<p>Again they offered him two wives. But he said, &ldquo;My
friend will marry them. I am traveling.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Again he passed on. And he came to a dwelling
place of people and found them shooting the hoop.
There stood a young man looking on. He joined him
as his friend. While they stood there together, he
said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Friend, let us go to your home.&rdquo; So he went with
him to his tepee.</p>

<p>The young man said, &ldquo;Grandmother, I have brought
my friend home with me; get him something to eat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She said, &ldquo;Where shall I get it from, that you say
that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Grandmother, how is it that you say so?&rdquo; asked
the stranger.</p>

<p>She replied, &ldquo;Waziya treats this people very badly.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg&nbsp;143]</a></span>
When they go out to kill buffalo, he takes it all, and
now they are starving to death.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now Waziya was a giant who caused very cold
weather and blizzards.</p>

<p>Then he said, &ldquo;Grandmother, go to him and say,
&lsquo;My grandchild has come on a journey and has nothing
to eat; so he has sent me to you.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the old woman went and standing at a distance,
cried, &ldquo;Waziya, my grandchild has come on a journey
and has nothing to eat; so he has sent me to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He replied, &ldquo;Bad old woman, get you home; what
do you mean by coming here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The old woman came home crying, and saying that
Waziya had threatened to kill some of her relations.</p>

<p>Star-born said, &ldquo;My friend, take your strap; we will
go there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The old woman interfered: &ldquo;I have with difficulty
raised my grandchild.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Grandchild replied to this by saying, &ldquo;Grandmother
is very much afraid.&rdquo; So the two went together.</p>

<p>When they came to the house of Waziya, they found
a great deal of dried meat outside. He put as much
on his friend as he could carry, and sent him home with
it; then Star-born entered the tepee of Waziya, and
said to him, &ldquo;Waziya, why did you answer my grandmother
as you did when I sent her to you?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg&nbsp;144]</a></span>
Waziya only looked angry.</p>

<p>Hanging there was a bow of ice. &ldquo;Waziya, why
do you keep this?&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>The giant replied, &ldquo;Hands off; whoever touches that
gets a broken arm.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Star-born said, &ldquo;I will see if my arm breaks.&rdquo; He
took the ice bow and snapped it into many pieces, and
then started home.</p>

<p>The next morning all the people went on the chase
and killed many buffaloes. But, as he had done before,
the Waziya went all over the field, gathered up all
the meat, and put it in his blanket.</p>

<p>Star-born was cutting up a fat cow. Waziya came
and stood there. He said, &ldquo;Who cuts this up?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am,&rdquo; answered Star-born.</p>

<p>Waziya said, &ldquo;From where have you come that you
act so haughtily?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whence have you come, Waziya, that you act so
proudly?&rdquo; he retorted.</p>

<p>Waziya said, &ldquo;Fallen Star, whoever points his finger
at me dies.&rdquo; The young man thought, &ldquo;I will point
my finger at him and see if I die.&rdquo; He pointed his
finger, but it made no difference.</p>

<p>Then Fallen Star said, &ldquo;Waziya, whoever points
his finger at me, his hand loses all use.&rdquo; So Waziya
thought, &ldquo;I will point my finger and see.&rdquo; He pointed
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg&nbsp;145]</a></span>
his finger. His forearm lost all use. Then he pointed
his finger with the other hand. It was destroyed even
to the elbow.</p>

<p>Then Fallen Star drew out his knife and cut up
Waziya&rsquo;s blanket, and all the buffalo meat he had gathered
there fell out. Fallen Star called to the people,
&ldquo;Henceforth kill and carry home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the people took the meat and carried it to their
tepees.</p>

<p>The next morning, they say, it was rumored that the
blanket of Waziya, which had been cut to pieces, had
been sewed up by his wife. He was about to shake it.</p>

<p>The giant stood with his face toward the north and
shook his blanket. Then the wind blew from the north.
Snow fell all about the camp so that the people were
all snowed in. They were much troubled. They said,
&ldquo;We did live in some fashion before; but now this
young man has acted so we are in great trouble.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But he said, &ldquo;Grandmother, find me a fan.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then she made a road under the snow, and went to
people and said, &ldquo;My grandchild says he wants a fan.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What does he mean by saying that?&rdquo; they asked and
gave him one.</p>

<p>Now the snow reached to the top of the lodges, and
so Fallen Star pushed up through the snow, and sat
on the ridge of the lodge. While the wind was blowing
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg&nbsp;146]</a></span>
to the south, he sat and fanned himself and made the
wind come from the south. Then the heat became
great. The snow went as if boiling water had been
poured over it. All over the ground there was a mist.
Waziya and his wife and children all died with the
great heat. But the youngest child, the littlest child of
Waziya, took refuge in the hole made by the tent pole,
where there was a frost, and so he lived. So they say
that is all that is left of Waziya now, just the littlest
child.</p>

<h2>QUARREL OF THE SUN AND MOON</h2>

<p class="subtitle">Omaha</p>


<p><span class="dropcap">&ldquo;I</span> am out of patience with you,&rdquo; said Moon to
Sun. &ldquo;Although I bring people together, you
scatter them. Thus many are lost.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have desired many people to grow,&rdquo; said Sun,
&ldquo;and so I have scattered them; but you have been putting
them in darkness and thus have you been killing
many with hunger. Ho! ye people!&rdquo; called the Sun.
&ldquo;Many of you shall mature. I will look down on you
from above. I will direct you, whatever you do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Moon said, &ldquo;And I, too, will dwell so. I will
collect you; when it is dark, you shall assemble in full
numbers, and sleep. I myself will rule you, whatever
you do. And we shall walk in the road, one after the
other. I will walk behind him.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>WHY THE POSSUM PLAYS DEAD</h2>

<p class="subtitle">Cherokee</p>


<p>Rabbit and Possum each wanted a wife, but no
one would marry either of them. They talked
over the matter and Rabbit said, &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t get
wives here. Let&rsquo;s go to the next village. I&rsquo;ll say I&rsquo;m
messenger for the council and that everybody must
marry at once, and then we&rsquo;ll be sure to get wives.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Off they started for the next town. As Rabbit traveled
the faster, he got there first. He waited outside
the village until people noticed him and took him into
the council lodge. When the chief asked his business,
Rabbit said he brought an important message: everyone
must be married at once. So the chief called a great
council of the people and told them the message.</p>

<p>Every animal took a mate at once, and thus Rabbit
got a wife.</p>

<p>But Possum traveled slowly. Therefore he reached
the village so late that all the men were married and
there was no wife for him. Rabbit pretended to be
sorry. He said, &ldquo;Never mind. I&rsquo;ll carry the same
message to the next village.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg&nbsp;149]</a></span>
So Rabbit traveled ahead to the next village. He
waited outside until they invited him to the council
lodge. There he told the chief he brought an important
message: there had been peace so long, there must be
war at once. The war must begin in the council lodge.</p>

<p>The animals all began to fight at once, but Rabbit
got away in just four leaps. Then Possum reached
the lodge. Now Possum had brought no weapons. So
all the animals began to fight Possum. They hit him so
hard that after a while he rolled over in a corner and
shut his eyes and pretended to be dead. That is why
Possum pretends to be dead when he finds the hunters
after him.</p>

<h2>BOG MYTH</h2>

<p class="subtitle">Dakota</p>


<p><span class="dropcap">B</span>ogs are very mysterious. Strange things, with
thick hair, remain at the bottom of a bog.
These things have no eyes, but they eat everything
which comes to them, and from their bodies water
flows always. When one of these Beings wishes, he
changes his place of abode. He lives at a new place.
Then the old place where he lived dries up; but a
fresh spring of water gushes from his new lodge. The
water of this spring is warm in winter; but in summer
it is as cold as ice. Before one dares drink of it, he
prays to the water, else he may bring illness on himself
for irreverence.</p>

<p>In the olden days, one of the Bog Beings was pulled
out of a bog and carried to the camp. A special tepee
was built for him. But so much water flowed all
around that the people were almost drowned. Then
those who were not drowned offered him food. He
sat motionless, gazing at them. But the food vanished
before they could see it go; and no one saw the Bog
Being eat it.</p>

<h2>COYOTE AND SNAKE</h2>

<p class="subtitle">Omaha</p>


<p><span class="dropcap">C</span>oyote was going in a straight line across the
prairie. While he was seeking something, a
person said suddenly, &ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; Coyote thought,
&ldquo;Who can it be?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He looked all around but saw no one. Then he
walked on a few steps, when some one said, &ldquo;Walk
around me!&rdquo; Then Coyote saw it was Snake.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; said Coyote. &ldquo;When I walk here, I
do not wish to walk around anyone at all. You go to
one side. Get out of my way!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Snake replied, &ldquo;I am here. I have never thought
for a moment of giving place to anyone!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Even if you think so,&rdquo; said Coyote, &ldquo;I will run over
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you do so, you shall die,&rdquo; said Snake.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why should I die? There is nothing that can kill
me,&rdquo; said Coyote.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come! Step over me. Do it in spite of me,&rdquo; said
Snake. Then Coyote stepped over him. And Snake
bit him. But Coyote did not feel it.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg&nbsp;152]</a></span>
&ldquo;Where is it? You said that if I stepped over you,
I should die. Where have I received my death blow?&rdquo;
said Coyote.</p>

<p>Snake made no reply and Coyote walked on. After
some time he came to a creek. As he was about to
drink, he saw himself in the water. He seemed very
fat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whew!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I was never so before. I am
very fat.&rdquo; Saying this, he felt himself all over; but
that was all he did. Then he walked on until he felt
sleepy. He said, &ldquo;I am very sleepy.&rdquo; So he pushed
his way into the thick grass and fell asleep. Coyote
did not wake up. Snake had told the truth.</p>

<h2>WHY THE WOLVES HELP IN WAR</h2>

<p class="subtitle">Dakota</p>


<p><span class="dropcap">O</span>nce upon a time an Indian found a wolf den,
and began digging into it to get the cubs.</p>

<p>Wolf Mother appeared, barking. She said,
&ldquo;Pity my children,&rdquo; but he paid no attention to her.
So she ran for her husband.</p>

<p>Wolf Father soon appeared. He barked. Still the
man dug into the den. Then Wolf Father sang a
beautiful song. He sang, &ldquo;O man, pity my children,
and I will teach you one of my arts.&rdquo; He ended with
a howl which caused a fog. When the Wolf Father
howled again, the fog disappeared.</p>

<p>The man thought, &ldquo;These animals have mysterious
gifts.&rdquo; So he tore up his red blanket into small pieces.
He tied a piece around the neck of each of the wolf
cubs, as a necklace. Then he painted them with red
paint and put them back into the den.</p>

<p>Wolf Father was very grateful. He said, &ldquo;When
you go to war hereafter, I will go with you. I will
bring about whatever you wish.&rdquo; Then the man went
away.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg&nbsp;154]</a></span>
After a while the man went on the warpath. Just
as he came in sight of the village of the enemy, a large
wolf met him.</p>

<p>Wolf said, &ldquo;By and by I will sing. Then you shall
steal their horses when they least suspect danger.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the man stopped on a hill close to the village. And
the wolf sang. After that he howled, making a high
wind arise. The horses fled to the forest, but many
stopped on the hillside. When the wolf howled again,
the wind died down and a mist arose. So the man on
the warpath took as many horses as he pleased.</p>

<h2>HOW RABBIT ESCAPED FROM THE WOLVES</h2>

<p class="subtitle">Cherokee</p>


<p><span class="dropcap">O</span>nce upon a time, Wolves caught Rabbit. They
were going to eat him, but Rabbit said he
would show them a new dance. Now the
Wolves knew that Rabbit was a good dancer, so they
made a ring around him.</p>

<p>Rabbit pattered with his feet and began to dance
around in a circle, singing,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">On the edge of the field I dance about,</span><br />
<span class="i0"><i>Ha&rsquo; nia lil! lil! Ha&rsquo; nia lil! lil!</i></span><br />
</div>
</div>

<p>Then the Rabbit stopped a minute. He said, &ldquo;Now
when I sing &lsquo;on the edge of the field,&rsquo; I dance that
way&rdquo;&mdash;and he danced over in that direction; &ldquo;and
when I sing &lsquo;<i>lil! lil!</i>&rsquo; you must all stamp your feet
hard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Wolves liked that. They liked new dances.</p>

<p>Rabbit began singing the same song, dancing nearer
to the field, while all the Wolves stamped their feet.
He sang the song again, dancing still nearer the edge
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg&nbsp;156]</a></span>
of the field. The fourth time he sang it, while the
Wolves were stamping their feet as hard as they could.
Rabbit made one jump off and leaped through the long
grass. The Wolves raced after him, but Rabbit ran
for a hollow stump and climbed inside. When the
Wolves got there, one of them put his head inside, but
Rabbit hit him on the eye and he pulled his head out.
The others were afraid to try, so they went away and
left Rabbit in the stump.</p>

<h2>HOW RABBIT LOST HIS FAT</h2>

<p class="subtitle">Omaha</p>


<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>t first all the four-footed animals were fat. The
one who made them wished to know if they
looked well so fat. So he called all the four-footed
animals together. He seized by the head each
one who did not look handsome with the fat, and
scraped it all off.</p>

<p>At length someone took Rabbit to him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fat makes me handsome,&rdquo; said Rabbit &ldquo;I will
be the one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me see! Come here!&rdquo; said the one who made
the animals. Then he made Rabbit fat. Then he
looked at him. &ldquo;Fat makes you ugly beyond measure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So he seized Rabbit by the head and scraped off the
fat from the base of his neck. But he pulled suddenly
at the flesh in the space between the shoulders. Therefore,
ever since then Rabbit has had a hollow space
between his shoulders, and only in that place is there
a piece of fat.</p>

<p>At length the person who made the animals saw that
Raccoon was the only person who looked well when
fat. So he made the whole body of Raccoon fat.</p>

<h2>HOW FLINT VISITED RABBIT</h2>

<p class="subtitle">Cherokee</p>


<p><span class="dropcap">L</span>ong ago, in the old days, Flint lived up in the
mountains, and all the animals hated him
because he had helped to kill so many of
them. All the arrowheads were made of flint. They
used to have councils. They tried to think of some
means of killing him. But everybody was afraid to go
near to his house, until at last Rabbit, who was the
boldest, offered to try to kill Flint.</p>

<p>So Rabbit asked the trail to Flint&rsquo;s house. At last
he reached the house.</p>

<p>Flint was standing at the door of his lodge when
Rabbit reached there. He said, &ldquo;<i>Siyu!</i> Hello! Are
you the fellow they call Flint?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; that&rsquo;s what they call me,&rdquo; said Flint.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is this where you live?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; this is where I live.&rdquo;</p>

<p>All the time Rabbit was looking at the lodge and all
about him. He was trying to think how to kill Flint.
Rabbit had expected Flint to invite him into his lodge.
But Flint only stood in the door.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg&nbsp;159]</a></span>
Rabbit said, &ldquo;My name is Rabbit. I&rsquo;ve heard a
good deal about you, so I came to see you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Flint said, &ldquo;Where is your lodge?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Down in the broom-grass field near the river,&rdquo; said
Rabbit.</p>

<p>Flint said, &ldquo;I will come and visit you after a while.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rabbit said, &ldquo;Come now and have supper with me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Rabbit coaxed Flint until he said yes, and the
two started down the mountain side together.</p>

<p>When they came near Rabbit&rsquo;s hole, Rabbit said,
&ldquo;There is my lodge, but in summer I stay outside here,
where it is cooler.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So he made a fire and they had their supper on the
grass. When supper was over, Flint stretched out on
the grass to rest. Rabbit picked up some heavy sticks
and his knife, and cut a mallet and wedge.</p>

<p>Flint looked up and said, &ldquo;What is that for?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Rabbit, &ldquo;I like to be doing something
and they may come in handy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Flint lay down again and soon he was sound asleep.
Rabbit spoke to him once or twice, but he did not
answer. Then Rabbit came over to Flint and with one
blow of the mallet drove the stake through Flint. Then
he ran with all his might for his own hole. But before
he reached it, there was a loud explosion, and pieces
of flint flew all about. That is why we find flint in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg&nbsp;160]</a></span>
so many places now. One piece struck Rabbit and
cut him just as he dived into his hole. He sat listening
until everything was quiet again. Then he put his
head out to look around, just as another piece fell. It
cut his lip, just as we see it now.</p>

<h2>HOW RABBIT CAUGHT THE SUN IN A TRAP</h2>

<p class="subtitle">Omaha</p>


<p><span class="dropcap">O</span>nce upon a time Rabbit dwelt in a lodge with
no one but his grandmother. It was his custom
to go hunting very early in the morning. But
no matter how early in the morning he went, a person
with a very long foot had been along, leaving a trail.
Rabbit wished to know him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;I will go in advance of that
person.&rdquo; Having risen very early in the morning, he
departed, but again it happened that the person had
been along, leaving a trail. Then Rabbit went home.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Grandmother,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;though I arrange for
myself to go first, a person goes ahead of me every time.
Grandmother, I will make a snare and I will catch
him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why should you do it?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hate the person,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>Again Rabbit departed. And again had the footprints
gone along. So Rabbit lay waiting for night
to come. Then he made a noose of a bowstring, setting
it where the footprints were commonly seen.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg&nbsp;162]</a></span>
Next morning Rabbit reached the place very early,
to see what he had caught in his trap. And it happened
that he had caught the Sun. Running very fast, he
went homewards to tell about it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Grandmother,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I have caught something
or other but it scares me. Grandmother, I wished to
take away my bowstring, but I was scared every time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So he went there again with a knife. This time
he got very near it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have done wrong. Why have you done it?
Come and untie me,&rdquo; said the Sun.</p>

<p>The Rabbit, although he went to untie him, kept
going past him a little on one side. Then he made
a rush with his head bent down and his arm stretched
out, and cut the bowstring with his knife. And the
Sun rose into the sky. But Rabbit had the hair between
his shoulders scorched yellow by the heat of the Sun as
he stooped and cut the bowstring. Then Rabbit arrived
at his lodge.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am burnt. Oh, grandmother! the heat has left
nothing of me,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>Grandmother said, &ldquo;Oh, my grandchild! I think
the heat has left to me nothing of him!&rdquo;</p>

<p>From that time Rabbit has always had a singed spot
upon his back, between his shoulders.</p>

<h2>HOW RABBIT KILLED THE GIANT</h2>

<p class="subtitle">Omaha</p>


<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>hen Rabbit was going on a journey, he
came to a certain village. The people said,
&ldquo;Halloo! Rabbit has come as a visitor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On meeting him, they said, &ldquo;Whom did you come
to see?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, I will go to the lodge of any one,&rdquo; said
Rabbit.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But the people have nothing to eat,&rdquo; they said.
&ldquo;The Giant is the only one who has anything to eat.
You ought to go to his lodge.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Yet, the Rabbit passed on to the end lodge and
entered it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Friend, we have nothing to eat,&rdquo; said the host.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, my friend,&rdquo; said Rabbit, &ldquo;when there is
nothing, people eat anything they can get.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At length the Giant invited Rabbit to a feast.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh ho!&rdquo; called the man whose lodge Rabbit had
entered. &ldquo;Friend, you are invited. Hasten!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now all the people were afraid of the Giant. No
matter what animal anyone killed, the Giant kept all
of the meat.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg&nbsp;164]</a></span>
Rabbit arrived at the lodge of the Giant. As he
entered, the host said, &ldquo;Oh! Pass around to that side.&rdquo;
But Rabbit leaped over and took a seat. At length
food was given him. He ate it very rapidly but left
some which he hid in his robe. Then he pushed the
bowl aside.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Friend,&rdquo; he said to the Giant, &ldquo;here is the bowl.&rdquo;
Then he said, &ldquo;Friend, I must go.&rdquo; He sprang past
the fireplace at one leap, at the second leap his feet
touched the chest of the Giant&rsquo;s servant, and with
another leap he had gone.</p>

<p>When Rabbit reached the lodge where he was visiting,
he gave his host the food he had not eaten. The
man and his wife were glad to eat it, since they had
been without food.</p>

<p>Next morning, the crier passed through the village,
commanding the people to be stirring.</p>

<p>They said, &ldquo;The Giant is the one for whom they are
to kill game.&rdquo; So they all went hunting. They scared
some animals out of a dense forest and shot at them.
Rabbit went thither very quickly. He found Giant
had reached there before him and taken all the game.
When Rabbit heard shooting in another place, he went
thither, but again found the Giant was before him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is provoking!&rdquo; thought Rabbit.</p>

<p>When some persons shot at game in another place
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg&nbsp;165]</a></span>
Rabbit noticed it, and went thither immediately, reaching
the spot before the Giant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Friend,&rdquo; he said to the man who had killed the
deer, &ldquo;let us cut it up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The man was unwilling. He said, &ldquo;No, friend, the
Giant will come by and by.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pshaw, friend,&rdquo; said Rabbit. &ldquo;When one kills
animals, he cuts them up and then makes an equal distribution
of the pieces,&rdquo; said the Rabbit.</p>

<p>Still the man refused, fearing the Giant. So Rabbit
rushed forward and seized the deer by the feet.</p>

<p>When he had only slit the skin, the Giant arrived.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have done wrong. Let it alone,&rdquo; Giant said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What have I done wrong?&rdquo; asked Rabbit. &ldquo;When
one kills game, he cuts it up and makes an equal distribution
of the pieces.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let it alone, I say,&rdquo; said the Giant.</p>

<p>But Rabbit continued to insert the knife in the meat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will blow that <i>thing</i> into the air,&rdquo; said the Giant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Blow me into the air! Blow me into the air!&rdquo;
said Rabbit.</p>

<p>So the Giant went closer to him, and when he blew
at him the Rabbit went up into the air with his fur
blown apart. Striding past, the Giant seized the deer,
put it through his belt, and departed. That was his
custom. He took all the deer that were killed, hung
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg&nbsp;166]</a></span>
them on his belt, and took them to his lodge. He was
a very tall person.</p>

<p>At night Rabbit wandered around, and at last went
all around the Giant&rsquo;s lodge. He seized an insect and
said to it, &ldquo;Oh, insect! You shall go and bite the Giant
right in the side.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At length when it was morning, it was said the Giant
was ill. Then he died.</p>

<p>The people said, &ldquo;Make a village for Rabbit!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Rabbit said, &ldquo;I do not wish to be chief. I have
left my old woman by herself, so I will return to her.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>HOW THE DEER GOT HIS HORNS</h2>

<p class="subtitle">Cherokee</p>


<p><span class="dropcap">L</span>ong ago, in the beginning, Deer had no horns.
His head was smooth like a doe&rsquo;s. Now Deer
was a very fast runner, but Rabbit was a famous
jumper. So the animals used to talk about it and wonder
which could go the farther in the same time. They
talked about it a great deal. They decided to have a
race between the two, and they made a pair of large
antlers to be given to whoever could run the faster.
Deer and Rabbit were to start together from one side
of a thicket, go through it, and then turn and come
back. The one who came out of the thicket first was
to receive the horns.</p>

<p>On a certain day all the animals were there. They
put the antlers down on the ground to mark the starting
point. Everyone admired the horns. But Rabbit
said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know this part of the country; I want to
look through the bushes where I am to run.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the Rabbit went into the thicket, and stayed a
long time. He was gone so long the animals suspected
he was playing a trick. They sent a messenger after
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg&nbsp;168]</a></span>
him. Right in the middle of the thicket he found
Rabbit, gnawing down the bushes and pulling them
away to make a clear road for himself.</p>

<p>The messenger came back quietly and told the animals.
When Rabbit came back, they accused him of
cheating. Rabbit said, &ldquo;No,&rdquo; but at last they all went
into the thicket and found the road he had made.
Therefore the animals gave the antlers to Deer, saying
that he was the better runner. That is why deer have
antlers. And because Rabbit cut the bushes down, he
is obliged to keep cutting them down, as he does to this
day.</p>

<h2>WHY THE DEER HAS BLUNT TEETH</h2>

<p class="subtitle">Cherokee</p>


<p><span class="dropcap">O</span>ne day after the race which they did not run,
Rabbit stretched a large grapevine across the
trail, gnawing it nearly in two in the middle.
Then he went back on the trail, took a run, and jumped
up at the vine. He did this again and again. At last
Deer came along and asked him to tell what he was
doing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see?&rdquo; said Rabbit. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so strong I
can bite through that grapevine at one jump.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Deer said, &ldquo;Do it.&rdquo; Rabbit ran back, made a long
leap, and bit through the vine where he had gnawed
it before.</p>

<p>Deer said, &ldquo;Well, I can do it if you can.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Rabbit stretched a larger grapevine across the
trail but without gnawing it in the center. Deer ran
back as he had seen Rabbit do, made a spring, and
struck the grapevine right in the center. It only flew
back and threw him over.</p>

<p>Deer tried again and again, but he was only bruised
and hurt.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg&nbsp;170]</a></span>
&ldquo;Let me see your teeth,&rdquo; said Rabbit. They were
long like a wolf&rsquo;s teeth but not very sharp.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No wonder you cannot do it,&rdquo; said Rabbit. &ldquo;Your
teeth are too blunt to bite anything. Let me sharpen
them for you so they are like mine. My teeth are so
sharp I can cut through a stick just like a knife.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Rabbit showed Deer a black locust twig, of
which rabbits gnaw the young shoots, which he had
shaved off as well as a knife could do it.</p>

<p>So Deer let Rabbit sharpen his teeth. But Rabbit
got a hard stone with rough edges and ground down
the Deer&rsquo;s teeth until they were blunt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now try it,&rdquo; said Rabbit to Deer. So Deer tried
it again, but he could not bite at all.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now you&rsquo;ve paid for your horns,&rdquo; said Rabbit as
he sprang through the underbrush. That is why the
Deer&rsquo;s teeth are blunt.</p>

<h2>LEGEND OF THE HEAD OF GOLD</h2>

<p class="subtitle">Dakota</p>


<p><span class="dropcap">A</span> man had four children. And they were all
young men, but they were poor and it seemed
as if they would die of laziness. The old man
said, &ldquo;Behold! old woman. I have the greatest pity
for my youngest child, and I do not wish him to die of
poverty. See here; let us seek the Great Mystery,
Wakantanka. If we find him, behold! I will give the
boy to him to train up well for me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, old man; you say well. We will do so,&rdquo; said
the old woman. So at once they went toward the Darkening
Land, seeking Wakantanka. They came to a
very high hill; and as they came to it, behold! another
man came there also.</p>

<p>The stranger said, &ldquo;For what are you seeking?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alas, my friend,&rdquo; the old man said, &ldquo;my child,
whom I pity, I wish to give to Wakantanka, the Great
Mystery, and so I am seeking him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, friend. I am Wakantanka,&rdquo; said the man.
&ldquo;My friend, give him to me. I will take him to my
home.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg&nbsp;172]</a></span>
So when the father gave up the boy, the Great Mystery
took him to a house that stood up like the clouds.
He said, &ldquo;Look at this house as much as you like. Take
good care of these horses. But do not look into the
little house that stands here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Having said this, he gave him all the keys. He
added, &ldquo;Yes, have a watch of this. Lo, I am going on
a journey.&rdquo; He said this and went away.</p>

<p>It was evening; he came home with a great many
men, who sat down, filling the house. When they had
been there a good while one of them said, &ldquo;The boy
is good; that is enough.&rdquo; Saying this, he went out. In
like manner, all the men went home.</p>

<p>Then again Wakantanka said, &ldquo;Behold, I go on a
journey. Stay here and keep watch.&rdquo; So again he went
away.</p>

<p>While the boy was watching, one of the horses said,
&ldquo;Friend, go into the little house where you are commanded
not to look, and inside in the middle of the
floor stands something yellow. Dip your head in that
and make haste&mdash;we two are together. When he
brings home a great many men, they will eat you, as
they will eat me, but I am unwilling&mdash;we two shall
share the same,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>So the boy went into the little house. In the middle
of the floor stood a round yellow thing into which he
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg&nbsp;173]</a></span>
dipped his head. Immediately his head became golden
and the house was shining and full of light.</p>

<p>Then he came out and jumped on the horse that had
talked to him and they fled.</p>

<p>They went very fast. Now when they had gone a
long way, behold! there came after them the one who
called himself Wakantanka. He shouted, &ldquo;You bad
rascals, stop! You shall not live! Where will you go
in such a small country as this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Saying this he came toward them and they were
much frightened. Again he shouted, &ldquo;You bad rascals,
stop! You shall not live.&rdquo; And indeed it seemed
as if they could not live.</p>

<p>Then the horse said, &ldquo;Take the egg you have and
throw it behind us.&rdquo; The boy did so. At once the
whole country became a sea. He who followed was
obliged to stop. He said, &ldquo;Alas, my horse, have mercy
on me and take me to the other side. If you do, I will
value you very highly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I am not willing to do that,&rdquo; the horse replied.
But he continued to urge. Then he threw himself
down from above the water, so that when he came to the
middle of it, he went down and both he and the horse
were drowned. But the boy passed safely on.</p>

<p>So he came to the dwellings of people and remained
there. But from behind they came to attack and fought
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg&nbsp;174]</a></span>
with them. But the boy turned his head around, and
his head was covered with gold; also the horse he sat
upon was golden, and those who came against him were
thrown off their horses and only a few remained when
the battle was over. Again, when they returned to the
attack, he destroyed them all. So the boy was much
thought of by the people.</p>

<h2>THE MILKY WAY</h2>

<p class="subtitle">Cherokee</p>


<p><span class="dropcap">N</span>ow the Indians had a corn mill, in which they
pounded the corn into meal. Several mornings
when they came to the stone in which the
corn was pounded, they saw that some of the meal had
been stolen. Therefore they looked at the ground.
They found the tracks of a dog.</p>

<p>The next night, the people watched, and when the
dog came from the north, they saw him begin to eat
meal out of the stone bowl. Then they sprang out and
whipped him.</p>

<p>The dog ran howling back to the north, dropping
the meal from his mouth as he ran. Therefore he left
behind a white trail where we now see the Milky Way.
But the Cherokees called it &ldquo;Where-the-dog-ran.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>COYOTE AND GRAY FOX</h2>

<p class="subtitle">Ponca</p>


<p><span class="dropcap">G</span>ray fox was very fat. Coyote said,
&ldquo;Younger brother, what has made you fat?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Elder brother,&rdquo; said the Gray Fox, &ldquo;I lie
down on the trail in the way of those who carry crackers,
and I pretend to be dead. When they throw me in
the wagon, I lie there, kicking the crackers out. Then
I leap out and start home eating. It is the crackers
which make me fat. Elder brother, I wish you would
do likewise. Elder brother, you have large feet, so
I think will knock out a great many crackers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Coyote went to the place and lay down in the trail.
When the white man came along, he threw Coyote into
the wagon. The white man thought, &ldquo;It is not the
first time he has acted in this way,&rdquo; so he tied the feet
of Coyote. Having put the Coyote in the wagon, the
white man went to his house. He threw Coyote out
near an old outhouse. Then the white man brought a
knife, and cut the cords which bound Coyote&rsquo;s feet. He
acted as if Coyote was dead, so he threw him over his
back and started off for the house.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg&nbsp;177]</a></span>
But Coyote managed to get loose and ran homeward.
He went back to get even with Gray Fox.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, younger brother,&rdquo; said Coyote, &ldquo;you have
made me suffer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You yourself are to blame,&rdquo; said Gray Fox. &ldquo;Be
silent and listen to me. You brought the trouble
on yourself as you lay down in the place where the
white man came with his load of goods.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, younger brother, you tell the truth,&rdquo; said
Coyote. But Gray Fox had tempted him.</p>

<h2>ICTINIKE AND THE TURTLE</h2>

<p class="subtitle">Omaha</p>


<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>ctinike was journeying. When he came in
sight at a bend of a stream, Big Turtle was sitting
there in a sheltered place warmed by the sun.
Ictinike drew himself back out of sight, crouching at
intervals as he retraced his steps, and ran down the
hill to where Big Turtle was.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why! How is it that you continue to pay no attention
to what is going on? It has been said that yonder
stream is to dry up so that all the four-footed animals
that frequent the water have kept close to the deep
water,&rdquo; said Ictinike.</p>

<p>Big Turtle said, &ldquo;Why! I have been coming here
regularly, but I have not heard anything at all. I
usually come and sit in this place when the sun gets
as high as it is at present.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hurry!&rdquo; said Ictinike, &ldquo;for some of the young
men died very soon for want of water. The young
otters died, so did the young muskrats, the young beavers,
and the young raccoons.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come, let us go,&rdquo; said Big Turtle. So Ictinike
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg&nbsp;179]</a></span>
departed with him. As he accompanied him, Ictinike
sought for a dry bone. Having found one that would
be good as a club, Ictinike said, &ldquo;Friend, go on.
<i>Mingam.</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>When he was alone, Ictinike seized the bone, and
before long overtook Big Turtle, walking along beside
him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Friend,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;when a person walks, he
stretches his neck often.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Big Turtle began to stretch his neck very far, and
he was walking with his legs bent very much. As he
was going thus, Ictinike gave him a hard blow on the
neck, knocking him senseless, and he did not stop beating
him until he had killed him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ha, ha!&rdquo; said Ictinike, as he carried Big Turtle
away. &ldquo;There are some days when I act thus for
myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He kindled a fire and began to roast Big Turtle.
Then he became very sleepy, and said, &ldquo;Ho! I will
sleep, but you, O, Ijaxe, must keep awake. Big Turtle,
when you are cooked, you must say, &lsquo;<i>Puff!</i>&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>So he went to sleep. Now Coyote came along, very
cautiously. He seized Big Turtle, pulled one of the
legs out of the fire, and sat there, biting off the meat.
When he had eaten all the meat on all the legs, he
pushed the bones back just as they had been before,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg&nbsp;180]</a></span>
arranged the fire over them, and left after putting
everything just as he had found it.</p>

<p>At length Ictinike awoke. He pushed into the ashes
to find Big Turtle, took hold of a leg, and pulled it
out. Only that leg came out. &ldquo;Pshaw!&rdquo; said he.
Then he tried another leg, with a like result, and still
another, but only the bones appeared. When he had
pulled out the fourth leg, he was astonished. All at
once he exclaimed, &ldquo;Surprising! I had already eaten
the Turtle, but I had forgotten it.&rdquo;</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg&nbsp;181]</a></span></p>
<h2>ICTINIKE AND THE CREATORS</h2>

<p class="subtitle">Omaha</p>


<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>ctinike married and dwelt in a lodge. One
day he said to his wife, &ldquo;Hand me that tobacco
pouch. I must go visit your grandfather, Beaver.&rdquo;
So he departed.</p>

<p>As he was entering Beaver&rsquo;s lodge, Beaver said, &ldquo;Ho,
pass around to one side.&rdquo; And they seated Ictinike on
a pillow. Beaver&rsquo;s wife said, &ldquo;We have been without
food. How can we give your grandfather anything to
eat?&rdquo; Now Beaver had four young ones.</p>

<p>The youngest Beaver said, &ldquo;Father, let me serve
for food.&rdquo; So the youngest Beaver served for food.
Beaver&rsquo;s wife therefore gave some of the meat to
Ictinike, who ate it. But before letting him eat it,
Beaver said to him, &ldquo;Be careful lest you break even
a single bone by biting! Do not break a bone!&rdquo; Yet
Ictinike broke one of the toe bones.</p>

<p>After the meal, Beaver gathered the bones, put them
in a skin, and plunged them beneath the water. In a
moment the youngest Beaver came up from the water,
alive again.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg&nbsp;182]</a></span>
When the father said, &ldquo;Is all right?&rdquo; the son said,
&ldquo;Father, he broke one of my toes by biting.&rdquo; Therefore,
from that time, every beaver has had one little
toe (the next to the little one), which has seemingly
been split by biting.</p>

<p>When Ictinike was about to go home, he pretended
he had forgotten about his tobacco pouch, which he
left behind. So Beaver said to one of the children,
&ldquo;Take that to him. Do not go near him, but throw it
to him when you are at a great distance from him, as
he is always very talkative.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then the child took the tobacco pouch and started
after Ictinike. After getting in sight of the latter,
Little Beaver was about to throw the pouch, when
standing at a great distance; but Ictinike called to
him, &ldquo;Come closer! come closer!&rdquo; When young
Beaver took the pouch closer, Ictinike said, &ldquo;Tell your
father that he is to visit me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When young Beaver reached home, he said, &ldquo;Oh,
father, he said you were to visit him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Beaver replied, &ldquo;As I feared that very thing, I said
to you, &lsquo;Throw it to him while standing at a great distance
from him.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Beaver went to visit Ictinike. When he arrived
there, Ictinike wished to kill one of his own children,
as Beaver had done, and was making him cry by hitting
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg&nbsp;183]</a></span>
him often. Beaver was unwilling for him to act thus,
so he said, &ldquo;Let him alone! You are hurting him!&rdquo;
Then Beaver went to the stream where he found a
young beaver that he took back to the lodge, and they
ate it.</p>

<p>On another day, Ictinike said to his wife, &ldquo;Hand me
that tobacco pouch. I must go call on your grandfather,
Muskrat.&rdquo; So he departed. As he was entering
Muskrat&rsquo;s lodge, the host said, &ldquo;Ho, pass around to
one side.&rdquo; And Ictinike was seated on a pillow.</p>

<p>Muskrat&rsquo;s wife said, &ldquo;We have been without food.
How can we give your grandfather anything to eat?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Muskrat said, &ldquo;Fetch some water.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The woman brought the water. He told her to put
it in the kettle and hang the kettle over the fire. When
the water was boiling very fast, the husband upset the
kettle, and instead of water, out came wild rice! So
Ictinike ate the wild rice.</p>

<p>When Ictinike departed he left his tobacco pouch,
as before. Then Muskrat called one of his children,
and said, &ldquo;Take that to him. Do not go near him!
Throw it to him when you are a great distance from
him, as he is always very talkative.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the child took the tobacco pouch to return it to
Ictinike. When he was about to throw it to him, he
said, &ldquo;Come closer! Come closer!&rdquo; When the child
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg&nbsp;184]</a></span>
took the pouch closer, Ictinike said, &ldquo;Tell your father
he is to visit me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When the young Muskrat reached home, he said,
&ldquo;Oh, father, he said that you were to visit him.&rdquo; Muskrat
replied, &ldquo;As I feared that very thing, I said to you,
&lsquo;Throw it to him while standing at a great distance
from him.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Muskrat went to see Ictinike. And Ictinike
said to his wife, &ldquo;Fetch water.&rdquo; The woman went after
water. She filled the kettle and hung it over the fire
until it boiled. When Ictinike upset the kettle, only
water came out. Ictinike wished to do just as Muskrat
had done, but he was unable. Then Muskrat had the
kettle refilled, and when the water boiled he upset it,
and an abundance of wild rice was there, which he
gave to Ictinike. Thereupon Muskrat departed, leaving
plenty of wild rice.</p>

<p>On another day, Ictinike said to his wife, &ldquo;I am
going to see your grandfather, Kingfisher.&rdquo; When he
arrived there, Kingfisher stepped on a bough of a large
white willow, bending it down so far that it was horizontal;
and he dived from it into the water. He came
up with a fish, which he gave to Ictinike to eat. And
as Ictinike was starting home, he left one of his gloves,
pretending he had forgotten it. So Kingfisher directed
one of his boys to take the glove and restore it to the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg&nbsp;185]</a></span>
owner. But he charged the boy not to go near him,
as Ictinike was very talkative and might detain him
too long. Just as the boy was about to throw the glove,
Ictinike called, &ldquo;Come closer! Come closer!&rdquo; So the
boy carried the glove closer. And Ictinike said, &ldquo;Tell
your father that he is to visit me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boy said to his father, when he reached home,
&ldquo;Oh, father, he said you were to visit him.&rdquo; Kingfisher
replied, &ldquo;As I feared that very thing, I said
&lsquo;Throw it to him while you stand at a great distance
from him.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Kingfisher went to see Ictinike. When he
arrived there, the host climbed upon a bough of a large
white willow, bending it until it was horizontal. Then
he leaped from it and plunged into the water. It was
with great difficulty that Kingfisher seized him and
brought him to land. Ictinike had swallowed more of
the water than he liked. Then Kingfisher plunged into
the stream, brought up a fish, which he gave to Ictinike.
But Kingfisher departed without eating any portion of it.</p>

<h2>HOW BIG TURTLE WENT ON THE WARPATH</h2>

<p class="subtitle">Omaha</p>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>he people dwelt in a very populous village.
Big Turtle joined them. And people dwelling
at another village came regularly to war
against them. Having killed one person they went
homeward. Big Turtle cooked for the warpath. He
caused two persons to go after guests. The servants
whom he sent after guests were Redbreasted Turtle and
Gray Squirrel. He made two round bunches of grass
and placed them at the bottom of the stick to which the
kettle was fastened.</p>

<p>Now they were coming. They came in sight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ho, warriors!&rdquo; said Big Turtle. &ldquo;Warriors, when
men are injured, they always take revenge. I cook this
for the warpath. I cook sweet corn and a buffalo
paunch. You will go after Corn Crusher for me,&rdquo; saying
this to his servants. &ldquo;Call to Comb, Awl, Pestle,
Firebrand, and Buffalo Bladder also,&rdquo; said Big Turtle.</p>

<p>The two men went to call them. They called to
Corn Crusher. &ldquo;Corn Crusher, be sure to bring your
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg&nbsp;187]</a></span>
bowl! Corn Crusher, be sure to bring your bowl!
Corn Crusher, be sure to bring your bowl! Corn
Crusher, be sure to bring your bowl!&rdquo; Four times they
called.</p>

<p>They called to Comb. &ldquo;Comb, be sure to bring your
bowl!&rdquo; So they called four times.</p>

<p>They called to Awl. &ldquo;Awl, be sure to bring your
bowl!&rdquo; So they called four times.</p>

<p>Then they called to Pestle. &ldquo;Pestle, be sure to bring
your bowl!&rdquo; So they called four times.</p>

<p>They called to Firebrand, too. &ldquo;Firebrand, be
sure to bring your bowl!&rdquo; So they called four times.</p>

<p>Then they called to Buffalo Bladder. &ldquo;Buffalo
Bladder, be sure to bring your bowl!&rdquo; So they called
four times to him.</p>

<p>Then the criers reached home, having invited the
guests.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, war chief,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;all heard it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>All those who were called arrived at the lodge of
Big Turtle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ho! Oh, war chiefs! Corn Crusher, Comb, Awl,
Pestle, Firebrand, and Buffalo Bladder, though those
people have been injured they do not seem to stir. Let
us go on the warpath for them,&rdquo; said Big Turtle. &ldquo;Let
us go in four nights.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He commanded Corn Crusher to cook. &ldquo;O war
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg&nbsp;188]</a></span>
chief, Corn Crusher, you will cook. And you, O
Comb, will cook on the night after that. And you, O
Awl, will cook, and complete the number.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That many war chiefs, four, cooked. They were
war chiefs. The rest were servants.</p>

<p>The people of the village said, &ldquo;Why! Of the persons
who have been called, who is cooking for the warpath?&rdquo;</p>

<p>And one said, &ldquo;Why! Big Turtle cooked. Pshaw!
Has he gathered all those who cannot move well
enough, those who cannot move fast enough?
Pshaw! If the foe find them out, they will destroy
them. When a war chief has sense, he will carry on
war.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Corn Crusher cooked. He cooked turnips, and he
cooked a buffalo paunch with them, just as Big Turtle
had cooked one with sweet corn. Awl cooked wild
rice. Comb cooked other things.</p>

<p>Big Turtle said, &ldquo;Time enough has passed. Let us
go at night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So they departed. Big Turtle made leggings with
large flaps. He tied short garters around them. He
rubbed earth on his face and he reddened it. He wore
grass around his head. He put white feathers on top
of his head. He took his gourd rattle thus. He rattled
it. He sang the song of the war chief:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg&nbsp;189]</a></span>
&ldquo;Big Turtle is coming back from touching the foe,
it is said, you say. He is coming back from touching.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He walked, stepping very lively in the dance. He
walked around them. As they went, it was day.</p>

<p>At length a young Buffalo Bull came. &ldquo;Warriors,
wait for him,&rdquo; said Big Turtle.</p>

<p>He said to Buffalo Bull, &ldquo;While I walk on a journey,
I am in a great hurry. Speak rapidly. Why are you
walking?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, war chief, it is so. As they have told of you
while you have been walking, I thought that I would
walk there with you, and I have sought you,&rdquo; said
Buffalo Bull.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do so,&rdquo; said Big Turtle. &ldquo;I wish to see your
movements.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Buffalo Bull rolled himself back and forth. He
arose suddenly. He thrust repeatedly at the ground
with his horns. He pierced the ground and threw
pieces away suddenly. He stood with his tail in the
air and its tip bent downward. An ash tree stood there.
He rushed on it. Pushing against it, he sent it flying
through the air to a great distance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O war chief, I think I will do that, if they speak
of vexing me,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look at the persons with whom I am traveling.
There are none who are faint-hearted in the least
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg&nbsp;190]</a></span>
degree. You are not at all like them. You have disappointed
me. Come, begone,&rdquo; said Big Turtle.</p>

<p>Again Big Turtle sang the song. &ldquo;Big Turtle is
coming back from touching the foe, it is said, you say.
He is coming back from touching,&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>Again they departed. &ldquo;Warriors, pass on!&rdquo; said
he.</p>

<p>There before them lay a stream, which was not
small. They crossed it. Firebrand was ahead, walking
with a great effort. At length, because he was
weary, he plunged into the water and was extinguished.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O war chief, I am not going beyond here with
you,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Remain here for a while,&rdquo; said Big Turtle.</p>

<p>Having reached the other side, they departed. At
length a Puma came.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Warriors, wait for him. I suspect what he will say.
Stand in a row,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Speak quickly,&rdquo; he said,
addressing Puma.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, O war chief,&rdquo; said Puma. &ldquo;It was told of you
regularly, saying you walked on a journey. And there
I wish to walk, so I have sought you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; said Big Turtle. &ldquo;Let me see your ways.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Puma made his hair bristle up all over his body.
He bent his tail backward and upward. He went leaping
to the bottom of a small hill. Having caught by the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg&nbsp;191]</a></span>
throat a fawn, about two years old, he came back, making
it cry out as he held it in his teeth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think I will do that, O war chief, if anything
threatens to vex me,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do something else,&rdquo; said Big Turtle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, O war chief; that is all,&rdquo; said Puma.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have disappointed me,&rdquo; said Big Turtle.
&ldquo;Look at these persons with whom I am. Where is
one who is imperfect? You are very inferior. Come,
depart. You have disappointed me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They departed. At length when they reached the
foot of a hill, Black Bear came.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O war chief, again one has come,&rdquo; said the
warriors.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suspect what he will say, warriors. Wait for
him. Stand in a row,&rdquo; said Big Turtle. &ldquo;Ho,&rdquo; he
said, addressing Black Bear. &ldquo;Come, speak quickly.
What is your business? When I walk on a journey, I
am in a great hurry,&rdquo; said Big Turtle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, O warrior, it is so. It was told of you regularly
that you walked on a journey. And as I desired to
walk there, I have sought you diligently,&rdquo; said Black
Bear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ho! Do something,&rdquo; said Big Turtle. &ldquo;You may
have thought how you would do it. I wish to see your
ways.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg&nbsp;192]</a></span>
Black Bear pierced the ground with his claws, and
threw lumps of earth to a great distance. And there
stood an oak tree which had been blackened by fire.
He attacked it. Having hugged it, he threw it with
force to a great distance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O war chief, if anything vexes me, I think I will
do that,&rdquo; said Black Bear.</p>

<p>Big Turtle said, &ldquo;Ho! warrior, you have disappointed
me. These persons with whom I am&mdash;look
at them. There is none who is faint-hearted in the
least degree. You have disappointed me. Come,
depart. Thus do I regularly send off the inferior
ones.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They went into a dense undergrowth. At length
Buffalo Bladder was torn open, making the sound,
&ldquo;<i>Qu&acute;e</i>.&rdquo; &ldquo;Alas! I am not going beyond with you,&rdquo;
said he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ho, warrior. I will come back very soon. Remain
here for a while,&rdquo; said Big Turtle.</p>

<p>Again they departed. As they went, they reached a
bad path. Very high logs were lying across it. Redbreasted
Turtle failed to step over them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ho, O war chief,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I am not going
beyond here with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ho, warrior. I will come again very soon. Remain
here for a while,&rdquo; said Big Turtle.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg&nbsp;193]</a></span>
Again they departed. As they went, behold, a Big
Wolf came.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O war chief, again one has come,&rdquo; said they.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suspect what he will say, warriors. Wait for him.
Stand in a row,&rdquo; said Big Turtle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ho,&rdquo; he said, addressing Wolf, &ldquo;Come, speak
quickly, whatever may be your business. When I walk
on a journey, I am in a very great hurry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, O war chief. It is so. It was told of you regularly,
saying that you walked on a journey; and as I
desired to walk there, I have sought you,&rdquo; said Wolf.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ho! Show me what you can do,&rdquo; said Big Turtle.
&ldquo;You may have been thinking about it. I wish to see
your ways.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Wolf decorated himself. He reddened his nose; he
reddened all his feet. He tied eagle feathers to his
back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, do so. Do so. I wish to see your ways,&rdquo; said
Big Turtle.</p>

<p>Wolf turned himself round and round. He went to
the attack by the wood on a small creek. He killed a
deer. He brought it back, holding it with his teeth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O war chief, I think I will do that, if anything
vexes me,&rdquo; said Wolf.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have disappointed me,&rdquo; said Big Turtle. &ldquo;See
these people with whom I travel. There is none who is
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg&nbsp;194]</a></span>
faint-hearted in the least degree. Come, depart. Thus
do I regularly send off the inferior ones.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Warrior Gray Squirrel, go as a scout,&rdquo; said Big
Turtle. Gray Squirrel went as a scout. At length he
was coming back, blowing a horn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ho, war chief, he is coming back to you,&rdquo; they said.
Big Turtle went there. &ldquo;Ho, warrior. Act very
honestly. Tell me just how it is,&rdquo; said Big Turtle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, O war chief, it is just so. I have been there
without their finding me out at all,&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let us sit at the very boundary of their camp,&rdquo; said
Big Turtle. He spoke of going. &ldquo;Warriors, I will
look around to see how things are, and how many persons
there may be there,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>He came back. &ldquo;Warriors, let us go in that direction.
This far is a good place for sitting,&rdquo; he said.
So they moved forward. Then he said, &ldquo;O war chief
Corn Crusher, go to the end lodge of the village before
us, and sit on the outside.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Corn Crusher did so. A woman came out of the
lodge. When she saw him, she said, &ldquo;Oh! Heretofore
have I desired mush. I have found for myself an excellent
corn crusher.&rdquo; But when she pounded on the corn
with it, she hurt her hand. Then she threw it out.
&ldquo;Bad Corn Crusher!&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>He came back to Big Turtle, who was near. &ldquo;He
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg&nbsp;195]</a></span>
whom you call &lsquo;Corn Crusher&rsquo; has come back,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;having killed one right at the lodge.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Big Turtle said, &ldquo;O war chief Comb, make an
attempt. Sit in the door of the lodge where Corn
Crusher sat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Comb did so. He was very handsome. Then a
woman came out of the lodge. She found Comb.
&ldquo;Heretofore I have been without a comb. I have
found a good comb for myself,&rdquo; she said. Very soon
she combed her hair with it. Comb pulled out all the
hair on one side by the roots.</p>

<p>She said, &ldquo;A very bad comb, but I thought it was
good.&rdquo; She threw him away at the door. Then he
went back. He went back with the hair he had pulled
out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He whom you call &lsquo;Comb,&rsquo;&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;has come
back, having snatched all the hair from one at the
lodge.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; said Turtle. &ldquo;O war chief, when we reach
home, we shall cause the women to dance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Big Turtle said, &ldquo;O war chief Awl, make an
attempt. Go sit in the door of the lodge where war
chief Comb sat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Awl was very handsome. He was very good to look
at. He sat in the door of the lodge. A woman passing
out, found him. &ldquo;Oh! I have found a good awl for
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg&nbsp;196]</a></span>
myself,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Heretofore I have had no awl.
It makes me thankful.&rdquo; She went back to the lodge
with him. She spoke of sewing her moccasins with
him. &ldquo;I will sew my moccasins with it,&rdquo; she said.
She sewed them. She pierced her fingers with him.
She missed in pushing him, sending him with force.
There was much blood from her fingers. She threw
him away at the door. &ldquo;The awl is indeed bad. I
have indeed hurt myself. I have wounded myself
badly.&rdquo; She threw him far out from the door, sending
him homeward.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He whom you have called &lsquo;Awl,&rsquo; O war chief,&rdquo;
he reported, returning to Big Turtle. &ldquo;I stabbed one
right at the lodge; I killed her.&rdquo; He returned with his
spear very bloody.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O war chief,&rdquo; said the others to Big Turtle. &ldquo;Awl
is coming back, telling his own name. He has killed
one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Big Turtle said, &ldquo;Ho! O war chief. You make me
thankful. Since it is you, I will blacken my face. The
village shall be joyful. Ho! O Pestle, make an
attempt. You will lie in the door of the lodge where
Awl lay.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now Pestle was very handsome. Then he arrived
there. He lay where he was commanded to lie. A
woman went out and found Pestle. &ldquo;Oh! I have
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg&nbsp;197]</a></span>
found a very good pestle for myself. I had no pestle
heretofore,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>She took him back to the lodge. She took some corn.
She filled the mortar and pounded the corn. She beat
it fine. She thrust Pestle beyond, right on her knee.
She missed the mark in pushing, sending him with
force, and so she struck him on her knee.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Oh!</i> A very bad pestle,&rdquo; she said. She threw him
outside, sending him homeward suddenly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have been used to saying &lsquo;Pestle.&rsquo; He is coming,
having stabbed one right at the lodge. He has
killed one,&rdquo; said Pestle, returning. He reached Big
Turtle again. &ldquo;O war chief, I have killed one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You make me thankful,&rdquo; said Big Turtle. &ldquo;Ho!
warrior Gray Squirrel, make an attempt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O war chief, how can I do anything?&rdquo; said Gray
Squirrel. Now the lodges were placed among the trees.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will pass along the trees above the smoke
holes of the lodges. If they find you, they will shoot at
you. Do your best. Do your best to evade the blows
or arrows. If one goes aside, rush on him,&rdquo; said Big
Turtle.</p>

<p>At length a boy found Gray Squirrel. &ldquo;This moving
one is a gray squirrel,&rdquo; he said. They went in
a great uproar. They shot at him. They even hit
him with sticks. One boy stood aside. Gray Squirrel
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg&nbsp;198]</a></span>
attacked him and bit him. They said, &ldquo;Wonderful!
Heretofore the gray squirrel has been very easy to
approach, but we have failed. He has bitten us; we
have done nothing to him,&rdquo; they said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He whom you used to call &lsquo;Gray Squirrel&rsquo; is coming
back, having killed one right among them,&rdquo; he
called. He told it to Big Turtle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ho! real warrior, act very honestly,&rdquo; said Big
Turtle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O war chief, it is just so. I have killed one,&rdquo; said
he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ho! warrior, you make me thankful,&rdquo; said Big
Turtle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ho! warriors,&rdquo; said Big Turtle again. &ldquo;I, even I,
will make a trial. I shall not come back for some time.
Beware lest you go homeward. Beware lest you leave
me and go homeward.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He arrived there. Some ashes had been poured out.
They were extinguished. At length Big Turtle pushed
his way through. He went within. He sat within,
with his eyes sticking out, looking around. A woman
approached when it was morning. She stood very close
to where Big Turtle sat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will tread on my shield,&rdquo; he said. The woman
looked around. &ldquo;From what place does he speak?&rdquo;
she thought; therefore she looked around. Again he
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg&nbsp;199]</a></span>
said to her, &ldquo;You will tread on my shield. Stand
further away.&rdquo; And the woman found him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stand still. I send you with a message,&rdquo; said Big
Turtle. &ldquo;Go home and say, &lsquo;Big Turtle says he has
come to war. He says he has come desiring the chief&rsquo;s
daughter, whose body has been placed on the bough of
a tree.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The people came. All the people said, &ldquo;Break in his
skull suddenly.&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;How is it possible for you
to break in my skull suddenly? If you let your weapons
slip off suddenly from me each time, you will break
your legs with the blows.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They said, &ldquo;When the water is hot, it will be good
to put him in it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fie!&rdquo; said Big Turtle. &ldquo;When the water is hot
and I scatter it with kicking, many of you will be
scalded to death.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He tells what is probably true,&rdquo; they said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And if it be so, it is good to burn him,&rdquo; said the
people.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For shame! If I scatter the fire by kicking, I will
cause all the land to blaze. Beware lest many of your
children, too, die from the fire,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He tells what is probably true,&rdquo; they said.</p>

<p>A child begged for water. &ldquo;O mother, some water,&rdquo;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg&nbsp;200]</a></span>
it said. Big Turtle said, &ldquo;<i>Oh!</i>&rdquo; He tempted them
with reference to water.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cause the child to ask for water,&rdquo; said one.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean by that?&rdquo; said others.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When the child said, &lsquo;O mother, some water,&rsquo; this
one, Big Turtle, said &lsquo;<i>Oh!</i>&rsquo;&rdquo; answered one.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wonderful!&rdquo; they said. &ldquo;He is fearing the sight
of water.&rdquo; They took him to the water, holding him
by the tail. Notwithstanding Big Turtle clung to the
ground with his forelegs, they held his tail, and reached
the water with him. They threw him forcibly right
into the water. He walked the water for a while, crying
a little, and pretended he did not know how to swim.
He said, &ldquo;<i>Wi! wi! wi!</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wonderful! Throw him out into the middle of
the stream,&rdquo; they said. Again they sent him headlong.
He was wandering around. At length he sank. They
said, &ldquo;He is dead,&rdquo; and went homeward. &ldquo;You
should have done that to him at first,&rdquo; said the people.</p>

<p>When the people went homeward, some boys stood
there. Big Turtle approached, floating. He came
peeping. Some boys stood looking at the place where
the deed was done.</p>

<p>Big Turtle said, &ldquo;When Big Turtle came in the
past to war on you, you said that you killed him. Look
here at me.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg&nbsp;201]</a></span>
The boys went homeward to tell it. &ldquo;You said that
you killed Big Turtle, but as this one behind us showed
his body, he laughed at us. Big Turtle is he who is
alive.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ho! We attack him,&rdquo; said the people. They attacked
him. They arrived there.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In what place?&rdquo; said they.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In this place,&rdquo; said the boys.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is Otter? Where is Grass Snake? Let
those two seek him,&rdquo; said they.</p>

<p>Big Turtle sat under the mud at the bottom of the
water. Only the tip of his nose and his eyes were sticking
out. Snake and Otter sought him beneath the water.
They passed very near to him, and stepped regularly
over his head. When Otter was about to pass the
second time, Big Turtle bit him in the stomach.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ho! elder brother, you give me pain,&rdquo; said Otter.
Big Turtle said, &ldquo;Why do you seek me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did not seek you. As I desired food, we have met
each other,&rdquo; said Otter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, you wished to join those who desire to kill me,
so you sought me,&rdquo; said Big Turtle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O elder brother! O elder brother! O elder
brother! I pray to you. I have not sought you,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will by no means let you go from my mouth,&rdquo;
said Big Turtle.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg&nbsp;202]</a></span>
&ldquo;Ho! elder brother! How long before you will
open your mouth and let me go?&rdquo; said Otter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When the Thunder God has come back, I will let
you go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Halloo!&rdquo; shouted Otter to the people. &ldquo;He will
let me go when the Thunder God comes back. Halloo!
He bites me between the legs. Halloo!&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He says that he is bitten,&rdquo; said the people. &ldquo;He
says that he is bitten between the legs. Hit tent skins
for him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They made the tent skins resound by hitting them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ho! elder brother, the Thunder God has come
back,&rdquo; said Otter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They hit the tent skins,&rdquo; said the Big Turtle.</p>

<p>The people said, &ldquo;It is good to fell trees.&rdquo; They
began felling trees here and there. The trees said,
&ldquo;<i>Qwi! qwi!</i>&rdquo; as they fell.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ho! elder brother, the Thunder God has come
back,&rdquo; said Otter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are felling trees,&rdquo; said Big Turtle.</p>

<p>At length the Thunder God roared, very far away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ho! elder brother, he has come back,&rdquo; said he. Big
Turtle let him go. Otter was very thin. He went
homeward. He reached home very lean.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let the two birds drink the stream dry,&rdquo; said the
people. &ldquo;Bring the Pelicans here.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg&nbsp;203]</a></span>
When they came, the people said, &ldquo;Drink the stream
dry. A person came here to war and we killed him, but
he is alive. He laughs heartily at us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The birds drank the stream dry. There was only a
very small quantity left in which Big Turtle sat.</p>

<p>Big Turtle called, &ldquo;Ho! warrior Gray Squirrel,
be coming hither, wherever you may be moving. They
have almost killed me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gray Squirrel was coming back, crying loud. He
was coming back to attack them. He attacked the two
birds. He tore open their water pouches by biting.
He bit holes in them. At length all the water returned
to its former place. At the creek and the lake it was
as before; they were filled with water.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sew up their pouches for them,&rdquo; said the people.
So they sewed up the water pouches of the Pelicans.
They finished sewing them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come, drink it dry again. Do your best. Beware
lest we fail,&rdquo; said the people. They drank the stream
dry again. Again very little of the water was left.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ho! warrior Gray Squirrel, wherever you may
be moving. They have nearly killed me. Be coming
hither again,&rdquo; said Big Turtle. He came back again.
He bit and tore the throats in many places. It made
their throats very bad. He made them bad to be sewed
at all. It was difficult to sew them.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg&nbsp;204]</a></span>
&ldquo;Yet we shall fail,&rdquo; said the people. &ldquo;Gray Squirrel
is abominable! I think Gray Squirrel is the only
one with Big Turtle. I think he is the only one siding
with them. Therefore we have failed to hurt them,&rdquo;
said the people.</p>

<p>They ceased. When it was night, Big Turtle went
back. He reached his comrades again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ho! Warriors, when men get the better of their
enemies in a fight, they usually go homeward. I suspect
that your sisters are tired of waiting to dance!&rdquo;</p>

<p>They went homeward. He walked around them, rattling
his gourd.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Warriors, I said that I would do thus, and so it is,&rdquo;
he said. He burnt the grass.</p>

<p>He burnt the grass so that they might think he was
coming home after killing the foe. At length they
arrived at the village. They tied scalps to a stick.
Then those in the village said, &ldquo;Yonder come those who
went to war!&rdquo; The returning warriors raced around and around
as victorious warriors do. People said,
&ldquo;There they are coming home, having killed the people
of the enemy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>An old man shouted: &ldquo;Corn Crusher says that he
killed one. <i>Halloo!</i> He says he killed her right at
the lodge. <i>Halloo!</i> Comb says he killed one right
at the lodge. <i>Halloo!</i> Awl says he killed one right at
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg&nbsp;205]</a></span>
the lodge. <i>Halloo!</i>, Gray Squirrel says that he killed
three right in the midst of the people. <i>Halloo!</i> It is
said they held the war chief, Big Turtle, right among
them, in a great uproar. <i>Halloo!</i> It is said they failed
to injure him. <i>Halloo!</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Big Turtle walked very proudly, carrying his
shield. He went homeward to enter the lodge. He sat
there telling them about himself. As people wished to
hear it, they continued arriving there.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why did they fail, when they were so near you?
If you sat very near them, how is it that you are alive?&rdquo;
asked the people.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I pretended to be afraid of water, so I am alive,&rdquo;
he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If so, then those over there have no eyes. How is it
that they did not find you when you were alive?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I sat in the ashes, therefore I am alive. I have
come home, having killed people. Why did you doubt
me? As you did not take vengeance on the people who
used to kill you, I went to war on them myself. I killed
them. How can you doubt me? I will tell no more
about myself,&rdquo; said Big Turtle. &ldquo;I have ceased.&rdquo;</p>
